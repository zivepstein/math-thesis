<h1> Senior Math Thesis at Pomona College </h1>
<h2> How to Nagivate This Repo  </h2> 
<b>Writing:</b> All write-ups for the thesis. Most up to date version is ```math-thesis/writing/thesis-update.pdf```.
<b>nmf-imp:</b> All the code used to generate figures, plots and algorithms.
<b>Reading:</b> Papers used in the formation of the thesis
<h2> Timeline </h2> 
<b>Sep 1 - October 1</b>. Browse texts and papers. Develop a problem that is novel and can be interesting (hierarchical community detection, graph theoretic/viz etc) with possible data sets in mind. Starting crafting the algorithm. Bibliography/literature review completed: With the help of your advisor and by browsing texts and papers, you will clarify the scope of your thesis, the main sources that you will use, and the background material that you need to learn. Sometimes all of this will be pretty obvious and other times it will continue to be a work in progress throughout the semester.

<b>October  - November 1.</b> Settle on a dataset that fits the problem/algorithm and clean it. Finish the implementation of the algorithm.

<b>November - December 1.</b> Run algorithm on dataset and get initial results. Cursory app implementation / visualization. Begin thinking about thesis writing 
	 	 	 							
<b>December 16</b> One Chapter Done! Brainstorm for next steps to be completed over winter break (algorithm evaluation, extension, new dataset/implementation). Starting writing skeleton of first draft 
					
<b>January 20.</b> The first formal meeting of Math 191. 
					
<b>February 15. </b>First draft of your Senior Paper is due on Sakai at midnight in .pdf format. Start researching journals. Draft should be cohesive but should have some small number of holes to be filled in it. 
							
<b>April 5</b> A .pdf file of the final draft of the Senior Paper is due on Sakai at midnight.
