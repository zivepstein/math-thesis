something. We vent down to the Tillage. The cursed Russians had destroyed every thing. I went to Salang to bring some thing. Since I did not know anyone in Salang, I came back empty handed. Fortunately on the way back I met A’mer sahib (commander Masood) who was on his way to Salang. I told him that I had nothing. He gave me 7000 Afs. I went back to Salang and brought rice, wheat and cooking oil. I carried some on my back for the rest rented a donkey to transport it for me

A. Oh, some were killed by Russians and some by wolves, just two goats remained., my poor donkeys they were killed too by the Russians.
                            WHO SHOULD SPEAK FOR AFGHANISTAN
THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES ON 19 NOVEMBER, 1986:
A bizarre fracas occured at the United Nations when leaders of the Afghanistan resistance came to speak at a recent correspondent’s lunch. They were attacked and pummeled by ' diplomats' representing the Kabul regime, which owes its survival to the presence of 120,000 Soviet troops. The episode raises and interesting question. By what right does Kabul speak for Afghanistan in the General Assembly in the first place?
There is a powerful case in logic, justice and precedent for seating the Afghan resistance. Consider the parallel with another invaded country, Cambodia. For a decade the General Assembly has rejected the claims of the regime implanted by the Vietnamese and instead has rcognized a resistance coalition whose incongruous partners include the neutralist former chief of state. Prince Sihanouk, and mass-murdering Khemer Rouge.
