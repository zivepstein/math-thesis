Afghan diplomat criticizes UN human rights reporting
Dr. Felix Ermacora, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, is currently visiting Afghanistan and Pakistan to gather information about human right situation.
In Kabul he visited regime officials, including Yaqoubi, the minister of state security (WAD).
Abdur Rahman Pasjwak, a former Afghan diplomat at the UN, says Dr. [Ermacora's reports about the human rights situation in Afghanistan does not
reflect the realities. He told VOA that when the UN special rapporteur goes to Kabul, regime officers accompany him when he meets the people. "No one can speak freely out of fear of the regime officers," Pasjwak said.
He said when Dr. Ermacora has finished his report he shows it to the Kabul regime. The Kabul regime censors the report before it is published.
He said the UN should make arrangements for the people to talk without fear reprisals by the regime.
