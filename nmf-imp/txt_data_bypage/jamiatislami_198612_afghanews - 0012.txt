 MUJAHIDEEN’S MILITARY POSITION
 During the current year Mujahideen from all over Afghanistan fought well They repulsed enemy attacks, kept their controled areas free and in some cases went on the offensive and had major victories
 The Mujahideen have great potential. only a fraction of which has been used in the war so far Lack of efficient organization paucity of proper resouces, military, nonmilitary, political historical and local problems have prevented them from making full use of this potential Ideological strength, popular support and proper terrain are all working their side.
 The changes in the North under the command of Massoud is not an isolated case. It has a far reaching effect beyond its immediate organizational borders and it set a good example to other areas The enemy 's seven years of effort to destroy this example has failed
 THE AGONY OF A CIVILIAN POPULATION
 Like any other colonial war the Soviet war in Afghanistan is against the whole nation. To them the son who is fighting, the father who is farming and the mother who is preparing food and praying for the victory of her son are all the same This is why they are using everything they have against all the people Five million external refugees two million internal refugees, more than half a million dead and 75% of the villages and towns destroyed are the result of this unlimited war The people suffer Food is not available, medecine is scarce, education seased and no body feels secure Families are divided villages have become the target of Soviet reprisals. The Soviets ire trying to put extreme pressure on the population to force them to leave the country' :>r surrender Despite much talk very little has been done by the international community to help these honourable people It is now a problem for the resistance They fight against the Soviets and at the same time try to look after the people inside :he country With no resources it becomes increasingly difficult to walk on such a tight rope The Soviets are counting on the outcome of this policy to see the country finally leserted by its population The flow of refugees has continued to neighbouring countries.
 THE POLITICAL SIDE OF THE PROBLEM

  nviting Western journalists to Kabul during the winter of 19S6; successive mouncements for elections and elders assemblies the withdrawal (i) of some units hange of puppet leadership and the soft tone of Gorbachev during his trip to India re all part of this game These steps have given results and the Soviet have benefited ram them.Even some Western journalists who did not have accurate knowledge about he real situation were misled by these moves and published some articles painting a iro-Soviet picture on the situation in Afghanistan
  h the other hand. Mujahideen have also taken some political steps in 1986 which are mportantThe Coalition still exists and the change of leadership is taking place monthly Though its performance is not what we want, its survival is an achievement a itself The spokesman of the Alliance and three other leaders paid an offical visit to menca and France Though the controversy over the American visit prevented it rom achieving some of its aims generally speaking, it was a good step A delagation ras sent to New York on the occasion of the 41st session of the General Assembly and ie resolution passed there with 122 votes was a major achievement, The late visit of rof B Rabhani. leader of Jamiat Islami to the three African countries is a new door ;>r more political steps that should be followed
