Afghans lose a strong supporter
President Zias death in an air crash was indeed a great loss to the Mujahideen but It will not hamper the victory of the Mujahideen over the puppet regime in Kabul,
President 2ia-uf-Has was a great supporter of Jehad in Afghanistan, As the president of the Islamic Republic of Pakistanf he extended every assistance possible to the refugees and the Mujahideen,
He was personally committed to the cause of the Mujahideen and his comittment had ideological and national-interest grounds.
President Zia considered the struggle of Afghans against the Soviet invaders a holy war. He felt that supporting a Jehad in Afghanistan was his religious duty.
Being the leader of Pakistan, he also found it important for the security of Pakistan to oppose the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union,
Fighting the war in Afghanistan was the job of the Afghans themselves hut the big burden of three million refugees and the provision of opportunities for the Mujahideen to fight their war on the political front were unforgettable services the late President rendered to the Afghan people.
Taking sides with the Mujahideen in a war which was fought against the Soviet Union needed courage, foresightedness and a spirit of sacrifice, Zla had the courage to stand firm; fomightedness not to deal a half way solution and the spirit of sacrifice to bear the difficulties resulting from the Soviet-sponsored terrorism which claimed many lives in Pakistan,
Zia was appreciated for his Afghan stand ail over the world and will fee remembered forever because of his services in this respect.
Despite differences on other issues, the majority of the people of Pakistan went along with his Afghan policies, This could be counted as one of his major achievements.
Zla was martyred, possibly through a conspiracy designed by the enemys of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Mujahideen and refugees pay heartfelt tributes to President 2ia. The Supreme Council of the Alliance has renamed Kabul's biggest Mcsaue of Puii-Khttshti as 2ia-ul-Ha$ Moses uc, Refugees held big meetings in which tributes were payed to late President Zia and prayers were offered for his souk
Zia's death is a great loss for the Afghan Resistance,.They lost a brother who helped them to liberate their country. But this loss wilt not prevent the Resistance from achieving the final victory,
A positive thing after the tragic incident was the
peaceful transfer of newer and the assurances by the new President of Pakistan that there will be no change of policy in regard to Afghanistan.
If the Soviet, India and the puppet regime had any evil designs they were frustrated by the foresightedness of the new leadership of Pakistan and the cooperation of the people of Pakistan with their new leadership,
if the Soviets comply with the Geneva accords and withdraw their troops totally, the fall of the puppet regime is a matter of time,
The strength of the Resistance lies in its armed forces in the country and its popular support within the country which will not fade away because of President Zias demise.
