The use of Garlic (Allium sativum) for its purported health giving properties has an honorable tradition, being mentioned in 22 of 800 herbal remedies in the Codex Ebers, an Egyptian medical papyrus of 1550 BC. Bottom,however, acknowledged its major side effect when instructing his actors to “eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath”. Garlic has been advocated for various ailments including heart disease, headache, bites, worms, tumours, cancer, and infections. Recent work suggests that it has a possible role in reducing vascular disease. Popular interest is currently greatest in Germany, where garlic preparations are the largest selling ojver the counter drugs.
Garlic’s principal active agent is allicin, a sulphur containing compound, which, with its breakdown products, causes the characteristic odour. Allicin is formed enzymatically from an odorless precursor, alliin, when cloves are mechanically

disrupted. Other biologically active compounds related to allicin, ^uch asojoene, may also be extracted from fresh garlic.Garlic has beneficial effect on coagulation, platelet aggregation, vasodjlation, and serum lipid
concentrations. A fall in fibrinogen and an increase in fibrinolysis have been reported. Garlic extract reduces the formation of acute platelet thrombus in vivo in stenosed coronary arteries in doge platelet aggregation in vitro, although the mechanisms are unclear. Garlic’s vasodilatory properties have been shown in human skin and conjunctival vessels. The packed cell volume, plasma viscosity, and blood pressure all fall with garlic. Concentrations of triglycerides and total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol fall with garlic while the concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol rises (although there have been contradictory studies). A recent review concluded that whereas large doses of fresh garlic (7-28 cloves a day) had beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors, data for commercial preparations were unconvincing and there was inadequate evidence to recommend garlic supplementation.
One reason for the difficulty in showing the effectiveness of garlic is that active ingredients may be lost in processing. Carefully dried sliced cloves retain their potency, but extracts or oil prepared by using steam distillation or organic solvents may have little activity. In addition, the alliin content of natural garlic may vary 10-fold. Standardizing garlic products by using their potential for releasing allicin has been suggested.
