Greetings from Afghanistan.
 i am wnttmg to you as a Prisoner of War in Afghanistan. My name is Leonid Vyiku. A iittle about rayseif: I was born in Moldavia, in a small village called Skinoshika. Once when I was turning the dial on my reciever, I unexpectedly tuned in to your broadcast in the Russian language with some difficulty. 1 also managed to pick up your signal on other occasions.
 Of course I do not .know who you are actually, whh make those broadcasts, but 1 enjoyed them very much and am grateful for the interesting information contained in your transmissions All this does not only make the Prisoners of War bate the Soviet Union and the power of the Communists, but also the soldiers. Some of the soldiers probably listen into, but before 1 crossed, over to become a rebel, I know nothing about foriegn broadcasts. But now 1 am acquainted with Voice of America , Washington , the Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran", Tehran, the Voice of Free Europe' and the BBC from London, in both the Russian and Romanian languages.
1 imagine that you are emigrants from the Soviet Union or Prisoners of War, who stayed on overseas. 1 am writting to send you my warmest greetings, best wishes for the future and every success in your noble work. If you have respect for those who have isolated themselves from their homeland, tar from their parents, nearest and dearest friends, who have crossed over to the side of these noble rebels, for the sake of peace on earth, send a reply.
Yours respectfully (and impatientlyi from ail the rebels.
