Lack of money forces AIG to reduce its staff by half
Financial problems have breed the Afghan Interim government (AIG) to reduce he size of most of its minis-ries. About 4,000 Afghans lost their jobs as a result of this decision.
The ministries of health and education will function as before and the ministries of information and finance will be reduced to half of their present capacity. Other ministries will have only a handful of officers.
Sources closes to the AIG say that the donor countries have reduced their financial assistance to the AIG forcing it to take the unpopular decision of dismissing half its officials. Since this de-: cision was taken immediately after the outbreak of war in Gulf, those hostilities may have prompted it But the AIG has been facing financial problems for several months.
The dismissed AIG officials face tremendous problems. Most of them live in the city and have to pay house rent and feed their families. Some had left low-paying jobs to join the AIG, which offered higher salaries than the parties. The parties will be forced to help them on humanitarian grounds because most of them are not receiving any of the assistance given to the registered refugees in the camps.
Reduction of assistance to the AIG is a reflection of donors’ dissatisfaction with its performance. Failure to broaden its base and take proper political and
military initiatives may be among the reasons for reduction of assistance to the AIG.
Peter Tomsen, US envoy to the Afghan resistance, denied reports of a reduction in American assistance to the Mujahideen, calling it anti- American propaganda. He said the Gulf crisis had had no effect on US assistance to the Mujahideen. Despite his assurances, it is obvious that the AIG is getting less money than before; if there is no reduction in the scale of American assistance, the aid must now be flowing through different channels.
Saudi Arabia and the United States are the two main donors of aid to the AIG.
The Kabul regime described the event as a sign of the Mujahideen's political failure. The move might give a similar impression to ordinary Afghans at home and abroad. But it is worth mentioning that those ministries of the AIG affected by the austerity move were of symbolic importance and had practically no work to do.
The AIG was formed in February 1989 immediately after the Soviet troop withdrawal. The idea behind its creation was to provide an alternative to the Kabul regime which was expected to fall. The AIG faced serious problems when it failed to broaden its base and play a leading role in resistance military effortsi Despite all its difficulties it will continue to exist until an alternative is found for it

Anwari's brother dies
Sayyed Mahmood Anwari, the younger brother of Commander Anwari, died of a heart attack in Islamabad on January 15.
He began armed struggled against the communists in 1978 and participated in many military operations in Ghorband Valley and around Kabul. Mahmood was bom 38 years ago in Shaikh Ali of Ghorband District. He has left behind a widow and four children.
A memorial service was held on January 19, which a large number of refugees attended. Shaikh Asif Mohsini, Haraka Islmi leader, was the main speaker in the meeting.
volved in fighting in Kabul and some other parts of Afghanistan.
IBs band is famous for gun running, looting, rape and violence. His men fought a gun battle with Najib’s soldiers in Kabul some years ago when Najib was opening a conference. Several people died and Muslim himself was injured. He was taken to Soviet Union for treatment. This incident caused a lot of embarrassment for Najib, who had promoted Muslim to die rank of a General.
It is said that Muslim was a supporter of Babrak Karmal, the former leader of the regime. Although the regime says he died naturally, Najib's involvement in his death cannot be ruled out. There is a strong rivalry between Najib and Babrak and each has his own faction within the PDPA, which was recently renamed as the Homeland Party to disguise its communist nature.
