Although Soviet authorities have been claiming for decades that religion was a category of the past the number of believers in the U.SSR. is steadily increasing especially among Muslims
An article on religion in the U S S R appearing in the semi-official Belgrade daily 'Borba proves this point by portraying the conflict between atheism and Islam in Soviet central Asia since the 1917 October Revolution,
There are around 43 million Muslims in the Soviet Union, and their number is expected to reach 65 million by the end of this century,                             *
The majority of Soviet Muslims, says "Borba". live in six Central Asian Soviet Republics and their traditions are very strong Numerous mosques have been built in recent years and an increasing number of both educated and self-appointed Ulamas is evident This according to the article, is partly due to the influence of neighboring counties, especially Iran Portraits of Ayatollah Khomieni can be seen on many buildings in the Azerbaijan i capital of Baku
Borba quotes Doctor of Philosophy A Turnbov from Dushanbe as saying that the old concept by which modern education eradicates religion has become outmoded in the USSR where-many highly educated people are embracing Islam But most of the believers says Tursanov. were born after the October Revolution a fact we must not
overlook
                                      Islam is conquering new spiritual plains thanks to its ability to adapt to local spiritual needs and expectations, but is also able to use these needs for its own ends" he
concludes
To counter this revival Soviet authorities have encouraged atheist propaganda in the past, which culminated in the opening of an "institute for scientific atheism" by the
communist party s Academy for Social Sciences in 1964

Islam and Resistance is a translation of author Roy's L' Afghanistan Islam et Modernite Politique, which first appeared in mid-1985. It maries the academic skills of a trained sociologist with months of arduous and often downright dangerous field research inside Afghanistan over a period of several years since the Soviet invasion in 1979 The result is a wide-ranging analysis of the Afghan resistance and the society that underpins it in relation to the various interpretations of Islam current in the country None of this makes for light bedtime reading Roy is systematic in both defining his terms a good idea given the amount of confusion surrounding lags beloved of the Western pres? such as fundamentalist", "moderate", "tribal , and in exploring the historical antecedents of today s Mujahideen
He sets out by dissecting the nature of state and civil society in the Afghan context and the rift that has traditionally existed between them, and that to a significant degree underlies the present conflict He then goes on to examine the background of popular
