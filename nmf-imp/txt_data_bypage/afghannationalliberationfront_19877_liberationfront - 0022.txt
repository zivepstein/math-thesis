 threats, held on 25th December 1986, at the Aiwani-Sadar in Islamabad, said that acts of viola nee, which had recently taken place in Karachi, appeared to have been masterminded and committed by certain elements which entered Pakistan under the garb of Afghan refugees.
   In his closing remarks at the moot of scholars. Ulema, thinkers, scientists and journalists at the Aiwan-i-Sadar, Pakistan’s President said these acts of sabotage could not be attributed to the Afghan refugees who had been looked after here and were busy earning their livelihood by doing strenous manual labour. He said there was no precedent in
 the Islamic history where so much affinity prevailed between the Muhajireen and Ansars. Though seven years have passed after the influx of Afghan refugees there has not been a single instance when there was a clash between the Muhajirs and Ansars.
   The President of Pakistan said the enemies of Pakistan were extremely upset over the peace and harmony prevailing between the Muhajireen and Ansars and thought that it would be difficult for them to achieve their design unless they were made to fight with each other. Thus they tried to creat rifts between them which they thought would lead to serious clashes among the Afghan Muhajireen and the local people particularly in the Frontier and Baluchistan Provinces.
