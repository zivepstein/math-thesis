    Man's second basic right is to Live peacefully in his homeland In Afghanistan, five million people have been forcefully driven out of their homes. Because of the presence of about 150,000 Red Army Troops, political rights virtually do not exist The prisons are full of innocent people Torture and killing without trial are the routine practice of the puppet regime.
    Destruction of the economy and the means of production by continuous and indiscriminate Russian bombardments does not allow us to talk about the Afghan j people s economic rights
    We believe human rights to be an indivisible whole Implementation of human rights ia a society requires national independence independence from any type of hegemon ism and imperialism, be it Western nr Eastern
    Today Gorbachev is about to sign a disarmament agreement with Reagan Why not’ But it should be remembered that we, the people of the Third World countries, want the termination of the Yalta Treaty (which divides the world into the spheres of influence
    of the two Superpowers)
                                        FROM T.HE DiARY OF JEHAD
                                           (Part IV) by Mohammad Es hact MEETING THE COMMANDER
    I have known Commander Masood for a long lime and had the privilege of working with him inside the country One of the important part of my trip was to see him and know about his views and the situation in the area he works 1 was lucky to meet him and spend more than two weeks in his company watching what he was doing and
    discussing different aspects of the war.
    The rirsi important change I witnessed was in Masood himself 1 remember two years ago when 1 met him, he seemed very depressed Although he is more busy now he is relaxed The Circle of his close associates has enlarged. He works with people coming from different areas not only from the North but from other regions as well I think j this geographical expansion of his organization hits had a good effect on his morale
    During the past few vears Masood has not only tried to teach other Mujahideen effective ways of fignung the enemy but has tried hard to learn what he felt was needed. He ha' made considerable progress in Islamic studies He is being taught by
    competent religious scholars of the area
    Masood is full of humor His company is the company of happy souls He laughs and makes people laugh too, But his great skill js the combination of humor with serious work This makes voriciog with him very pleasant
    iNo doubt be is i genius in military strategy and tactics but his extra-ordinary skill is combining proper military tactics with political moves suitable for the time and the place He has <m-en<liag patience in fighting his way through mountains of political difficulties )o achieve his aim Sometimes he waits for years to do a 10b better rather i than spoil the situation through emotional nod nasty actions This patience has made it i possible for bina to acnievt* the difficult aim of co-ordinated action against enemy ■ targets
    Besides being a military man, he is a charismatic politician To him a co-ordinated attack against a garrison is a combination of both political and military efforts, the political side of which is heavier than the military side The type of struggle he is {. engaged in. has taught bun to be both a general and a politician____________
