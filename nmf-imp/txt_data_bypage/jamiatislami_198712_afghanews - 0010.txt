    • he Mujahideens morale is high and so is the morale of the civilian, population In short, a was a good year for the Mujahideen in their Jehad against the Soviets and their puppets
    THE POLITICAL SITUATION
    To deceive public opinion outside Afghanistan the Soviets ordered their puppets to announce a cease -fire and talk about what they called National Reconciliation This move caught the outside world by surprise The Mujahideen unanimously rejected both the ceasefire and the so-called National Reconciliation and asked for the unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops To the Mujahideen anything coming from the puppets is resectable because their regime is illegal and represents nobody but the Soviets
    The ceasefire was never observed, by the Mujahideen or by the Soviets and their • puppets The National Reconciliation program also failed to convince a major section of j the Afghan people. The puppet regime failed to get the support of the people and relies very much on Red Army support for its survival There is no evidence that the puppet ; could overcome this difficulty If the Soviet troops leave the regime will collapse and if they remain the regime will remain unpopular as the tool of a foreign power
    The Soviets wanted to use the above two initiatives the ceasefire and National Reconciliation to decrease the political cost of their invasion but (ailed to achieved any result The UN General Assembly passed a resolution, by a record majority of 12 v votes, calling for the withdrawal of foreign (Soviet) troops from Afghanistan
    Proximity talks between Pakistan and the puppet regime in Geneva have continued since !%2 and have brought no result so far Despite the optimism expressed by Mr Cordovez, the two sides are far apart and even si thev agree on The four instruments of the of the agenda there will remain a great number of questions to be solved before it becomes a workable agreement The mam question is the right for self determination of the Afghan people which is mentioned in the resolutions passed by UN but is not worked out in the present Geneva talks
    Under the present format of Genova talks there is no hope of achieving peace in the future
 !
    The human rights situation in 1%" was as bad as in the past Bombs are falling in the villages, prisons arc tilled with innocent people and the Soviets use torture to extract information from the prisoners The Refugee influx to neighboring countries continues and young people are pressganged into the puppet army to fight against their own people There is no freedom of any sort something which could be expected from an occupation force of a communist regime
