Who is who in Mujahideen
Cmdr. Sayyed Allauddin
Sayyed Allauddin, Jami'at commander in the center of Faryab, leads about 300 Mujahideen. He is famous for his fearless operations against the regime forces.
Here are some of his operations:
•Karwan Bashi post which was protected by 300 enemy troops were captured in 1989. In the operation 22 enemy troops were killed. Six Mujahideen were killed.
•In the same year, Deh Maida post was captured after killing 32 communists and wounding 12. Seven Mujahideen lost their lives in the attack.
•Deh Azizan post was captured in 1988. Twelve soldiers were captured and 14 guns seized in the operation in which Mujahideen suffered no casualties.
He has been supported in the fighting against the regime by two other Jami’at commanders in Maimana, Commander Attiyatullah and Sufi Samad. The later was killed some weeks ago.
Allauddin has learned fighting through practical' experience. Despite his participation in many wars he has not been wounded.
Allauddin started his armed struggle with his cousin Sayyed Noor Mohammad Hashimi, who organized the people against the communist regime. Hashimi was a great man with deep knowledge in Islam and reputation for honesty. He worked with Hashimi first as a Mujahid and later as a group commander.
When Hashimi was martyred in 1984, Allauddin took his place. Work
with Hashimi had a positive effect on Allauddin. Although he was not of Hashimi's caliber to maintain the standard of his work, he managed to protect his organization.
Allauddin is famous for his courage in the battlefield and Islamic character. He treats his Mujahideen and the people with affection, but he is a fierce enemy of the communists.
A close friend of his said Allauddin is hampered by a lack of higher education which prevents him from planning in advance and conducting a war of sophisticated strategy. He could be described as a good tactician.
Despite his military engagements, he has paid attention to the education of children in his area. He has opened a school which has eight classes and many mosque schools.
He treats the Ulama (religious scholars) with respect and makes use of their influence to persuade people to take part in Jehad.
Allauddin learned the basics of Islam in the mosque school of his village. At the age of seven he went to primary school. He stopped attending school after four years, and started to work with his cousin as a shopkeeper.
Sayyed Allauddin was . bom 32 years ago in Kohi Khana suburb of Maimana. His father, Sayyed Ebrahim was a Qari (one who has memorized Holy Quran). Allauddin is a Sayyed linked to the Persian speaking Aimaq. Commander Allauddin have two brothers helping him in Jehad. His third brother was killed in the war. He is married and has one child.
No accord between AIG, Shi as
The three-week long talks between the Wahdat party and the AIG ended without a major achievement. The delegation of Iran-based Wahdat party left Peshawar on July 14 with a hope to continue discussions in the future.
A member of the delegation told reporters that they had useful talks in Peshawar. The delegation met with all the Mujahideen leaders within and outside the AIG and held , talks with UN officials about humanitarian assistance to areas close to the Iranian border.
The delegation and AIG agreed on the constitution of a 12-member committee from both sides to deal with the problems between the Mujahideen in Uruzgan, Ghazni, Maidan and Bamyan provinces. The situation in Uruzgan is
tense because Hazara and Pushtun ethnic groups have clashed over control of land and pasture.
The Wahdat party delegation showed keen interest in the formation of a war council comprising the political leaders and commanders to escalate the war.
Views were also exchanged over the issue of elections. The Wahdat party insisted that 25 percent of the representatives should come from the Shia population of Afghanistan.
The Wahdat party is opposed to the participation of refugees living in the West in the formation of a leadership council for the resistance, but favors participation of all Muslim Afghans in the election.
