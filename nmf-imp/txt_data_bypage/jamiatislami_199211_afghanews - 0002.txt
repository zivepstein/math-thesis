Hezb refuses to abide by peace agreement
Hezb’s leader has set new conditions for the withdrawal of his forces from south of Kabul, apparently abrogating the terms of the ceasefire he signed after his August defeat outside the capital.
Talking to a gathering in Charasyab, the text of which was published in the Hezb newspaper, he said it would be unfair to withdraw his forces while Shura-i-Nazar forces remained in Kabul.
"I will withdraw my forces 10 kilometers if Shura forces withdraw five kilometers," he promised.
But according to the terms of the August 29 truce. Hezb forces must withdraw from around Kabul at the same time as General Dostum’s forces leave the capital.
In the same meeting, Gulbuddin remarked that he was not tired of war, and that waging Jehad (sic) was like offering prayers. ”1 do not become tired of praying, and do not ask how long should I pray,” he said.
Addressing a press conference in
Jalalabad alongside Shamali Khan, the spokesman for the Jalalabad Peace i Committee, he said he was pleased with result of his attacks on Kabul.
As a result of his rocket attacks, as many as 2,000 people were killed and several thousand more injured. The attack inflicted heavy material losses on the city, and forced hundreds of thousands of Kabulis to fiee.
Shamali Khan's presence at Hikmaiyar's press conference makes a mockery of his "peace" mission. Hikmatyar used the occasion to repeat his allegations against the government
Hikmatyar insisted that General Dostum and Jabar Qahraman, a Pushuin militia commander from Helmand whose men are guarding Hikmaiyar's headquarters in Charasyab. were "different"
Though he did not elaborate, one clear difference is that Dostum rebelled against and helped overthrow Najib, while Jabar remained loyal to the dictator until Najib left power and took refuge in a UN office in Kabul.

Hezb threatens BBC reporters
Hezb Islami has warned British	Broadcasting
Corporation reporters not to enter Afghanistan, and «has threatened their Afghan employees. A Hezb communique published in Pakistan accused the BBC of misquoting Hikmatyar. The BBC reported that he had said he was under pressure from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to compromise with the Islamic government.
The Hezb communique said BBC foreign correspondents will not be allowed to enter Afghanistan, and that Afghans working for the BBC Will be captured and tried as spies.
Hikmatyar has threatened the BBC in the past, but at the same time never hesitated to use the BBC and other world media to project his views. The BBC Pashto Service even allowed Hezb spokesmen to read an unedited "political" communique over the aL during August even as they and their Khalqi allies carried out a terrorist campaign of rocket attacks against the people of Kabul.
Andy Skrzypkowiak, a cameraman for BBC TV, was killed by Hezbis in Noonstan in 1986. The murderers were captured by Pakistani police but were released a few month later with the support of Hezb backers in Pakistan's security forces.
