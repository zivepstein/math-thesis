    Oi the 68th birthday of the Red Army Viladimir Govorov, Deputy Minister of Defence for the USSR said: " Soviet Array and navy have never and will never be used against pther peoples".
    In fact what the Soviet army has done in the past has been agai-nst other nations and it has interfered in their affairs. Several national movements have been crushed in Soviet block countries under the name of defending a socialist country against an imaginary outside threat. Afghanistan is a living example , for six years the Soviet atmy has been engaged in a ruthless, immoral and unjust war against the people of Afghanistan. This aggression has caused the death of half a million people and the displacement of more than 4 million refugees. The Soviet army has destroyed villages, degraded holy places and looted the property of the people.
    The Soviet army has proved to be one of the most barbaric,immoral and indisiplined armies of the world. They do not'respect anything and do not spare the lives of any inhocent civilian or even the animals . They do not believe in any values so they do not know any limit for their atrocities.
    The Soviet leaders may say any thing and can give hollow promises
to,the world. But the facts reveal their true nature.

   . Before the invasion of Afghanistan the Soviets could deceive some simple-minded people, but after seven years of involvement in a small peaceful, non-aligned neighbouring country it is difficult to hide behind slogans.
