  1 His honourable the Prime Minister is confusing separate issues. The situation in Afghanistan is completely different. In Afghanistan the regime (which was a Communist one) was deposed by the Soviet invasion and a puppet regime was imposed by them in Kabul. Soviet arguments that they were invited to Afghanistan are rejected by U.N resolutions which Greece has voted for.
    His honourable the Prime Minister should not be misled by the Soviet propaganda. Equally one should not be misled by the democratic name of the puppets. 75% of Afghanistan is destroyed, half a million people have been filled and more than four million others have become refugees. All this would not have happened if the regime y/as popular or the Soviets were not there.
    His honourable the Prime Minister should not provide justification for the existence of a quisling regime which has come to power by use of foreign forces and will survive only as long as they stay.
    We hope this statement is a slip of tongue, not a policy, because we can not beleive that his Excellency the Prime Minister of Greece would support a regime which was established by foreign forces and does not have any support internally or externally. In Afghanistan the case is clear. The war there is a true liberation war against the Soviets, The rule of the puppets is no more than the role of traitors and traitors do not deserve any sympathy.                                 *•
    On the other hand we are aware of the feelings of the Prime Minister about U.S military action in Libya to help the contras. But the war in Afghanistan is not a U.S-sponsored war. It started with a national decision and will continue until we decide it sbojald end. We are part of the muslim wprld, and non-aligned and third world countries. It is not necessary that a war against a super power is controlled by the other. May be in the past some liberation movements committed that mistake. We are independent and the whole idea of the war is to win our full independence.                                                          «
    Even in these difficult moments when we are facing a super power enemy with empty hands we have raised our voices against injustice committed anywhere by anybody. Our position towards the Palestine cause is a good example. We reject the injustices against the people of Palestine. We do this when the P.L.O. leadership is a close friend of our enemy, the Soviet Union and opposes Mujahideen.
    We assure his Excellency the Prime Minister and the rest of the world that the war in Afghanistan is the war of a nation who want to live free, free from outside influence. It is a noble aim and Afghans deserve every sort of help and encouragement in their difficult but noble mission.
