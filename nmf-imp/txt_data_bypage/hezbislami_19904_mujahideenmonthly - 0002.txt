
We want to establish an Islamic government in Afghanistan that is independent, non-aligned and Islamically elected. Our Jihad will continue until this goal is a reality.

We insist on elections as the only practical way for solving the current Afghan crisis. No other than an elected Islamic government will be able to put an end to the war and establish durable peace and security in Afghanistan.
The internal and external policy of our government will be based on Qur’an and Sunnah. We will make independent judgements on all international issues and maintain friendly relations with all states except those that are engaging in activities detrimental to our faith, independence and territorial integrity.

The Islamic state of Afghanistan will take all possible measures to protect the rights of all Afghan nationals and will promote science and technology for the reconstruction, development, self-reliance and self-sufficiency of our state.
