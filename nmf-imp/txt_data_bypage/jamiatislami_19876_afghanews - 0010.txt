Soviet supremacy is a great pleasure for us Though we live under different political conditions and make use of different methods of struggle our purposes are the same; to defend our national culture, regain our national independence and preserve our freedom and peace.
We regret our limited possibilities to support the freedom of Afghan people. In February 1%7 we held a demonstration in Kracow against the widespread use of torture in Afghanistan and thereby joined the international initiative to collect medicine for the Afghans Moreover the representative of Freedom and Peace in the United States has initiated Project Wounded to provide medical treatment in the US for wounded Mujahideen from Afghanistan
We fully realize that our activity principally has a symbolic value But to us solidarity, with all peoples violently forced to subjugation by the Soviet Union is of the greatest importance Our movement calls for an immediate withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghan territory We endorse the proposal to establish an unified government based upon the support of the Afghan people, able to guarantee the independence of the Afghan nation and the freedom of its inhabitants
This we wish ail Afghans and we send our special wishes to Commander Masoud. who has the admiration in wide circles of Polish people.
Long live independence!

                                   ANTI-MUSLIM RIOTS IN INDIA
Anti-Muslim riots in India as a result of which Muslims are being killed, their property destroyed and their worship places burned or degraded is a source of worry for all Muslims including Afghan Mujahideen who fight for the supremacy of the religion of God We are connected to the Muslims all over the world by the bond of faith and can not remain indifferent about their suffering *We draw the attention of the Indian Government to fulfill its responsibilities in providing protection for Muslims and other minorities So far Indian Government performance in this respect has been very poor and even Indian security forces are biased against Muslims
We sympathize w<th aL the victims of communal violence in India, in general and with our Muslim aethers in particular and hope for an immediate end to this tragic situation
