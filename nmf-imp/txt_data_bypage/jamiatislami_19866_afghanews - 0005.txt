                   LESS FRUIT FOR MAZAR AREA
    According to informed sources the people around Mazar will have very little fruit this summer. The reason for this is that after a very mild winter the blossom came early but this was then destroyed by severe weather in the springi
    Fruit compansates for the shortage of food* This year because of lack of rain and continous fighting the farm production will be less than last year and growing only a small amount of fruit adds to the problems of th. P«opl..                                                ■   ,
                          DIVIDED FAMILIES
    The war in Afghanistan is a disaster for the family system. Because of repeated offensives people move from one place to another. Some leave. the country and become refugees in neighbouring countries or other parts of the world. These people have left relatives behind* Some times they axe able to send letters but often they even do not know where members of their family are.                                  j
    Lack of economic opportunities and forced conscription in enemy controlled areas have forced a large number of young people to leave the country. They have left behind mothers, sisters, brothers even wives and Children.
    There are thousands who have children of 2 to 3 years old who they have never seen. They have only their photographs.
    Imprisonment is another cause of separation. Thousands of Afghans are suffering in jails and do not have permission to meet their families.
 By forced conscription a large number of people are taken to serve in the puppet army. They are either killed or blown up by mines when they want to desert. Others take refuge in neighbouring countries and their families do not know what has happened to them. The Communist coup and then the invasion was a great blow to family life arid this side of our society has been hit harder than Others.
    From all the signs one can see the tragedy will not come to an end in the near future. Every effort is being made by the enemy to establish themselves permanent. While this is happening the world is paying little^attention and the Soviets are not being criticised as they should be and^reasonable step is being taken to end this tragedy. As every one is a member of a family and knows how dear the family is more attention should be paid to this tragedy.
