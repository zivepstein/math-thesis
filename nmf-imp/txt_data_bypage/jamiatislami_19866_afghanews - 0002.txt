   While the annual resolutions of the U.N are a good base for a political solution the Geneva talks in their present format will not bring about any solution. If an agreement is reached that would legitimize the Soviet occupation and give legal status to the notorious puppet regime, it would not be a solution but the begining of more trouble for the people of Afghanistan, the region and the world as a whole,
              A CIVIL WAR OR THE WAR FOR LIBERATION
   The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Since then more than 100,000 men of the Red Army have been engaged in a war against the people of Afghanistan. Their invasion under whatever name it hides , is considered by the majority of the people of thet world as aggression « The struggle of the people of Afghanistan is aimed at getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan, This is why their struggle is a war for liberation.
   Unfortunately some irresponsible journalists have started to call this war of liberation a civil war. They want to give the impression that Afghans are killing Afghans and this way minimise moral pressure for the Soviet soldiers. It may be that they are arguing that- the pip-pet army is fighting Mujahideen. However the role of the puppet army is secondary and relies completely on the Soviets for all their activities.
   Furthermore history has recorded the fact that when an invading anny comes to occupy a land a few thousand materialistic opportunists bet* ray their people and join hands with the invading army while a large number of people axe also forced to work for'the invaders as soldiers. The quisling regime in Finland is a good example for understanding the puppet regime in Kabul, Before the Soviet invasion there was a war in Afghanistan. People wanted to get rid of the Communist regime. The regime had the material support of the Soviets and Soviet advisors even helped the regime against the Mujahideen. One may call that war a civil war because it was not a direct invasion. After 1979 the situation completely changed and the war for liberation started which has continued ever since.
   Some hard-line journalists use the term of rebel for Mujahideen even after the invasion and want to give legal status to the puppet regime in Kabul. Once the writer of this article asked a journalist why he insists on calling them rebels when he knew that the Mujahideen are fighting against foreigners, not a legal government. He said that that was true but his boss likes it that way. I hope the directors of the papers and news agencies become more realistic and mention us by our true name not by the terminology which our enemy uses.
