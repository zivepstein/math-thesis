                           SflARIATMADARI' S SAP DEMISE
   Ayatullah Kazem Shariatmadas i, an Iranian religious leader, passed after long sickness. Shariatmadari used to speak openly against Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and made use of different occasions to express his views on the matter. His death is a great loss for all rouslims, Iranian brothers and the Mujahid people of Afghanistan who lost a friend.
   May Allah give him heavenly peace.
                          ICRC MISSION A GAIN FOR. THE SOVIETS
    On March 26th, ICRC announced that his mission to send back 8 Soviet PWs to that country
 was successfully finished. Out of 11 PWs 3 chose to stay in the West.
    Mujahideen had agree! to deliver Soviets PWs to ICRC having in mind a similar action from the                                             Soviet  side. But ICRC team in Kabul was expelled after some months and not a
 single Afghan benefited from the deal.
    ICRC argument that they ^ not promi.se any excange is true but every’ body knows, that it was the real iotive beh',nH                   decision. It seems that ICRC still is interested
 to  continue this                                       'one-sided humanitarian mission' and they try to convince Mujahideen leaders
 to  give them more PWs. If ICRC call the release of Soviet        criminals who have invaded a
 nonaligned Islamic country, have killed half a million people and driven out more than four millions, 'a humanitarian mission’, whet about thousands of innocent Afghans who are suffering in Jails for defence of their count,. If the mission was a test case for Mujahideen good intentions they proved it.
     Asking                                            more.prisoners from Mujahideen under me present conditions is not logical act
 and it only serves the Soviet criminals.
