 Afghanistan, when they faced with tough resistance and received heavy blow from the Mujahid nation of Afghanistan.
      However, 27 April 1978, and 27 December 1979, are marked as the most unfortunate and dark days in the history of Afghanistan.
 LOYA JIRAGA: NAJIB ELECTED PRESIDENT:
      The announcement of Loya Jirga (Great Council), the election of Dr. Najib, as the President of Afghanistan, and the approval of the constitution for the country is another ridiculous and shameful declaration by the puppet, and unconstitutional Soviet backed regime in Afghanistan.
      Loya Jiraga (Great Council) in Afghanistan, according to the constitution, before the Soviet military intervention, compreised the members of Parliament and the Chairmen of the Provincial Council, and the King or President had also the power to nominate and include some tribal Chiefs’ elders. Professionals, spirituals and intellectuals to the national councils’. Loya Jirga was summoned by the Royal proclamation or Presidential decree, to pass the constitution, elect head of the State, or to declare war or make peace.
      Being a Soviet puppet and unconstitutional head of the State, how Dr. Najib is competent to conv^t J-ya Jirga (National Council) to elect himself President of Afghanistan. Moreover, who are remaining in the country to attend National Councils such as convened by puppet Najib? as the whole of Afghan intelligentsia have partly been killed, imprisoned by the Soviet puppet regime in Kabul and partly are living in exile in Pakistan, Iran, Europe and in the United States of America.
      Since the Afghan Mujahid nation has declared Jehad against the Soviet invading troops in 1978, more than 1.2 million Afghan Mujahideen have been martyred, injured and disabled, and 5.5 million more have fled the country and have sought refuge in Pakistan and Iran, and the country has been turned into a bloody scene, by the Soviet expansionists. It was a disgrace to Afghan Traditions to convene Loya Jirga while 120,000, Soviet Troops are present in Afghanistan.
      The meeting convened by Najib, cannot be called a Loya Jiraga rather than a meeting of the paid servants of Soviets for the appointment of Najib as the puppet President of Afghanistgan. Since the puppet regime in Kabul under the Communist system of government has denied the right to life, liberty, security dT person and freedon of expression to the Afghan Nation, how it is possible for the member of National Council to go against the wishes of the Soviet puppet President in Kabul, the socalled Loya Jirga, the flection of Najib and the passing of constitution are therefore illegal and unconstitunioal.
                                          THE UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTIONS:
      This is the ninth time since 1979, that the General Assembly of the United Nations has debated and passed the resolutions in regard to the problem of Afghanistan.
        * >•
      The Afghan Mujahid nation thanks all those member States who have supported the resolution in the United Nations, particularly the Islamic republic of Pakistan whose government, since the Soviet military intervention has strongly supported the Afghan Mujahid nation in the.international arena.
