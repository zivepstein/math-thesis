 indirect interferences of alien powers in the internal affairs of Islamic Afghanistan, one million of our people have been martyred, hundreds of thousand of our compatriots have been crippled and imprisoned, five millions have been forced to take refuge in the neighbouring Islamic countries, hundreds of thousand of innocent people have been displaced internally because of indiscriminate bombing and shellings and innumerable moral and material agonies and losses have been inflicted on our defenceless people.
    It is well known to the world that Russia, due to her expansionist policies, has been indirectly interferring in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and our nation with wisdom and bravery' has resisted these manipulations time and again. Finally when the Russians found the gains of their indirect interference at stake, as a result of the anned resistance of our people, it invaded our country with their savage Red Army forces on Dec. 27, 1979.
    The Russians in the course of their several years geno-cidal war, in spite of employing all of their military resources and satanic conspiracies and sparing no types of sophisticated and lethal weapons, could not overpower a people who consider Jihad in the way < of Allah (S.W.T) and the liberation of their country one of the best worships.
    Therefore, they hatched another plot in the name of
 ceasefire, national reconciliation and coalition government through Najib, that atheist and puppet ruler of Kabul who tries to bring off this conspiracy by using Islamic terminology. But our Mujahid nation is alive to all these tricks Our Mujahid nation would not be decieved by these empty overtures and would continue their armed resistance until the achievement of their lofty ideal.
    hr' case some individuals accept this deceptive ceasefire of Najib and his socalled national reconciliation offer, being fooled by this trick join the puppet government, in fact, such individuals will be considered as infilterated KGB and Khad agents who until now have managed to hide themselves in the ranks of Mujahideen and refugees and in the ranks of our Muslim nation at large.
    Ittehad-e-Lslami Mujahideen Afghanistan which is the only legitimate representative of the lofty ideals and aspirations of our Mujahid nation, explicitly declares that the cries for ceasefire, national reconciliation and coalition government raised by the Russians through Najib are part of the enemy tricks that will never hoodwink our heroic Mujahideen. '
    Ittehad-e-Islami Mujahideen Afghanistan in view of the mentioned facts, rejects the eihpty proposal of the Red Imperialism presented through its Slaves as follows:
 (A) CEASEFIRE:
 1)  Hie Russians through deceptive and garnished words of ceasefire, national reconciliation arid cessation of bloodshed want to pervert the Afghan issue in the minds of world people. Otherwise, what will be the"meaning of truce and national reconciliation and which sound logic will accept such offers in a situation where the forces of aggression have been spilling the blood of our innocent people for seven years for bolstering a, puppet communist regime and there is no sign in sight of the withdrawal of the forces of aggression and the cessation of their inhuman atrocities!?
 2)  In such a situation where the forces of aggression have not vacated our country and are still bent on the an position of their atheist and unpopular - regime on our people the acceptance of a ceasefire after all these sacrifices and sufferings will be tant-amount to a shameful accommodation and ignomi-nous surrender to the enemy.
 3)  Our Jihad has been started in the wake of Russian interferences in our internal affairs and their direct military intervention and aggression for the imposition of an unlslamic regime on our people The war will not stop unless the above two factors and reasons for the present conflict are removed. Upon the withdrawal of the Russian forces from our country, the overthrow of the Unislamic
