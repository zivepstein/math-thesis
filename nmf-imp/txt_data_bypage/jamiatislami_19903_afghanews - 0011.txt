PDPA Factions
The Peoples' Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) was formed in 1965 under the chairmanship of Noor Mohammad Taraki. The party wanted to bring to Afghanistan a Russian-style revolution.
After a while the party split into two factions bearing the same name, one headed by Taraki and other by Babrak Karmal.
The Taraki faction became known as Khalq because it published a paper by the name of Khalq (people) and Babrak's faction was called Parcham because the party published a paper called Parcham (flag).
The Khalq party remained united under the leadership of Taraki. Hafizullah Amin became the second man of the party.
The Parcham spilt once more. The new group was called Setam-i-Milli (National Depression party) which was headed by Mohammad Tahir Badakhshi. This splinter group claimed to fight for- the right of non-Pushtoon nationalities.
Parcham split for the second time giving birth a new party, called Khalq-i-Kargar (worker masses) led by Ghulam DastagirPanjshiri.
At one stage Khalq and Khalq-i-Kargar cooperated with each other, but retained their independent nature.
Setam-i-Milli also split into two factions, the moderate section under Tahir and the radical group under Bahruddin Bais. The Tahir group cooperated with the communist regime in Kabul, but the Bais group opposed the Taraki regime and launch armed at tacks against it. This group was responsible for killing the American Ambassador to Kabul, Mr. Dubs.
When Daud took power, the com munists assumed important positions in
the government. When Daud decided to improve his relations with other neighboring countries tension between him and the communists mounted. The Soviet Union which patronized all communist factions except the Moists forced them to unite their ranks to be able to replace Daud and run the country.
On April 27, the 'united PDPA' took power in a bloody coup. Taraki became the president and Babrak, vice president of the Peoples' Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
The honeymoon of the Khalq and Parcham did not last long. Babrak and Najib were sent abroad as ambassadors to Prague and Tehran respectively.
In the fall of 1979, Taraki was killed by Amin. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on December 27, 1979, ended Khalqi rule and brought Babrak and Najib back to power under the protection of the Red Army.
This event annoyed the Khalqis who were in the majority in the army. The Soviet army's presence prevented any open out-break of violence between the two factions but the Soviets failed to unite their ranks.
Parcham suffered another division when Babrak was replaced by Najib in 1986. Some people supported Babrak and others became loyal to Najib, the new chosen man of Moscow. Finally the Soviets admitting their failure to unite different communist factions, started to deal with each . group separately.
After the announcement of the multi-party system, different communist factions became active. The present coup of Khalqis against Parchamis is the continuation of old hostalities which will not end with the crush of the coup.
Mujahideen allow private traders to bring goods from Afghanistan
The Mujahideen will allow private traders to bring goods from Afghanistan to Pakistan except alcohol and drugs.
The Mujahideen parties and tribal leaders in Pakistan have agreed that goods from Afghanistan can be transported through a secondary route bypassing Jalalabad.
A Mujahideen leader Younus Khalis has said that the Kabul regime requested the Mujahideen to open the Toorkham trade route but this was rejected because the Mujahideen do not deal with the communists.
Toorkham is a main trade route which connects Kabul with Peshawar.
Despite fighting the road was open to trade until the fall of 1988. Since then, the Mujahideen have blocked the road.
The closure of Toorkham angered tribal leaders in Pakistan because their trade suffered. Russian and other foreign goods transported through the Soviet Union are brought to the tribal areas from Afghanistan. It is a profitable business because the goods entering the tribal area are not taxed.
