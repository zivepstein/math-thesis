More than 1500 enemy troops defected to the Mujahideen during fighting and a large number were captured. No figures for the casualties of the enemy troops were available. Ten Mujahideen were killed and 60 wounded during the operation.
After the fall of Khwaja Ghar, the Mujahideen captured some post of Ikhanom historic hill, qn the Soviet border and part of Dashti-i-Qala, about 15 kilometers north of Khwaja Ghar.
Shah Mahmood, an important mili-
tia figure, was among the prisoners. The Governor of Takhar and seven ranking military officers escaped to Soviet Union by helicopters before the fall of Khwaja Ghar.
The Kabul regime fired four SCUD missiles at Khwaja Ghar on May 15, killing several Mujahideen and local population. Regime's jets continued to bomb the liberated district from a high altitude. So far, 40 people have died and 30 injured as a result of firing SCUDs and aerial bombardments.
When the Mujahideen attacked Khwaja Ghar, diversionary attacks against the Kabul troops were launched in Kunduz, Baghlan and Mazar.
The attack on Khwaja Ghar was launched immediately after the end of the sixth meeting of the Supervisory Council ( SC). In this meeting military and political situation of the country was discussed by the SC commanders. Sources close to Supervisory Council say that the Mujahideen attack on Khwaja Ghar was delayed at least one month due to problems created by Commander Bashir of Hezb Islami	(Hikmatyar).
Originally, the attack was planned to coincide with operation oh Khost
The victory at Khwaja Ghar pushed the SC out of an undesirable situation imposed on it by shortages of supplies and problems arising from massacre of Jami'at commanders in Farkhar in 1989.
The news of victory at Khwaja Ghar pleased the Mujahideen and refugees because it was done with few casualties and with participation of most of the Mujahideen parties.
Prof. Rabbani, congratulating the victorious Mujahideen, said that victory at Khwaja Ghar demonstrated that the fall of Khost was not an isolated incident.
