Regime faces economic crises
A German paper says efforts by the Kabul regime to encourage foreign investment has brought little results.
Farm products in 1990 reached 28% of the pre-war figure. Most of the foodstuffs and other essential goods are brought from the Soviet Union. Kabul imports 380,000 tons of food from the Soviet Union each year, 200,000 of which is a gift
Exports of natural gas, which used to provide 43% of the country's export income, have been cut since 1989. The natural gas pipeline, which is 110 kilometers long, sends gas from northern Afghanistan to neighboring Soviet Uzbekistan.
Pak Jehad role lauded
Don Ritter, a US congressman from Pennsylvania, has said Afghan Mujahideen played an important role in forcing the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops and to abandon communism, to an extent, VOA reported.
He said the Kabul regime fired 1500 SCUD missile at Afghan villages in 1990.
He said the struggle of the Afghans, which resulted in the introduction of freedom in the Soviet Union, was not possible without the support of Pakistan. Praising the role of Pakistan in support of Jehad, he said Pakistan has allowed assistance to Afghans to pass through its territory.
In early 1980, when the Soviet em piie was expanding and Soviet-backed regimes in Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Southeast Asia had the upper hand, Pakistan stood with the Mujahideen in the front line.
