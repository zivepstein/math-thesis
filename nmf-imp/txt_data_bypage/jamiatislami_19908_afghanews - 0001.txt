Prof. Rabbani presented graduation certificates to 41 graduates of Jami’at Police Academy on July 11 in Peshawar.
On the occasion, the Jami'at leader said the establishment of law and'order is a key to the development of a country.
Jami'at Police Academy was established in 1978 to train young police officers. The Academy Commandant, Colonel Ghulam Ghous Nasiri, 50, said the school trains two types of po-icemen, the commissars - special branch officers - and police constables. The students are chosen from among high school graduates and trained for 18 months. In the addition to professional subjects, religious subjects are also taught. Nasiri said so far the academy has trained one hundred policemen of both types. The graduates are performing their duties in Jami'at offices and some of them are working for the AIG. Some bright students are accepted as instructors in the school.
The academy is staffed by 19 in.-structors. The instructors are former Afghan police officers.
Colonel Nasiri is. a graduate of a West German police school and has served in many important posts in Kabul and other provinces before the communist coup of 1978.
Nasiri was jailed by the communists and after 18 months was released in a general amnesty announced by the regime at the start of the Soviet invasion.
None of those trained so far have been assigned to posts in the liberated areas, a clear weakness on the part of the school.
If trained police officers are assigned to the liberated areas, they can introduce modem ways of estbalishing law and order. At the moment, the Mujahideen act as policemen in the areas they control.
The UN has started implementing a program of "voluntary repatriation" of Afghan refugees with the help of the Government of Pakistan. UN officials expect that a total of 250,000 refugees will return to Afghanistan within three months.
UN officials have set up 10 offices along the border with Afghanistan, four in Baluchistan and six in NWFP.
The ration card of each returning family will be bought for Rs.3300 (approximately $150) in cash and 300 kilogram of wheat.
The UN says the reports sent by the UN officials in Afghanistan indicates that the situation is ripe for the return of the refugees. It also says that its officials in Pakistan have talked to refugees in the camps and a considerable number of them have indicated their willingness to return. Some refugees have left already and have resettled in their areas, the UN says.
The UN says that in addition to the
aid recieved by card holder refugees at the border, the UN will provide assistance to all returnees inside Afghanistan.
The Pakistan Government supports the program and cooperates with UN officials in implementating the repatriation scheme. The US government also supports the UN-sponsored return of the refugees.
The Mujahideen leaders oppose the program because they think the situation inside is not conducive to the safe return of the refugees. Some of the Mujahideen leaders have even called the repatriation program "a conspiracy against Jehad" and have asked the Pakistan Government to reconsider its policy.
Reports from along the Afghan border say that only a few families returned their ration cards and went to Afghanistan. A BBC correspondent says in Toorkham post the UN office received no refugees on the first day of the UN repatriation program.
