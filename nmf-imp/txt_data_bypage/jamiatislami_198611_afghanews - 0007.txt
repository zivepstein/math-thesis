 of the military committee of Jamiat islami. He returnd back to the front in 1981,
 it was a coin evening and group of people were preparing the'grave . After saying the prayers for the martyred., the body was taken to the grave. While some men were putting the body into the grave an old man of aoout 75 addressed the martyred Major and said, "My son sleep beside your brother. Oh) my Allah i am quite happy for what you have chosen for the two of my sons."
 The old man was the father of two sons who had been martyred one after the other Every body weped except the old man who continued to repeat similar « words.
 Minutes later another voice mterupted the silence. This time it was* commander Masood who was giving order to his mujahideen to take ammunition to Shemali because the Soviets had launched an attack and he had recieved a request from the local Mujahideen for ammunition.
 The crowd dispersed and left the two brothers In peace.
 One may ask, Why the old man was so calm and what do his words mean'?
 Ttie old man was a muslim. He believed: that man is cheated by Allan and all his belongings including his Mfe is a gift from Allah, that this world is a testing ground and every one will be accountable to his God for his actions, those who do good will receive their reward in the next world.
 The most precious thing for man is his life. Giving that to Allan is the highest form of worship, it is a key to the door of eternal happiness.
 This way of belief has great impact on the behaviour of men towards martyrdom and those martyres. Hartyres are not considered dead The famiiies of the martyres are proud of having them. This way of thinking gives moral support to the resistance and martyredom of a person does not demoralize nis companions.
 Here are some verses from the Holy Quran about those who nave oeen martyred in the way of Allan.
