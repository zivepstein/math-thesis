                             NEW FACES OLD POLICIES
 The notorious Babrak was pushed aside and Haji Mohammad was appointed as the head of the Revolutionary Council of the regime Like any other change it was a Soviet-dictated move to give a better image to the puppet regime
 The Soviets have tried in the past to give the impression that the puppet regime has broadened its base and the introduction of a so-called non-party member to a ceremonial post is part of this game
 Their choice Haji Mohammad Tsamkani who has served as an MP during the time of the King and as the governor of Kunar during the time of Daud . is said to know- about the customs of the tribes and can get along with them easily
 The Soviets hope that his appoinment will decieve some people inside as well as outside Afghanistan
     0 mankind! LDe created you from a single (pair! of male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that you may despise each other)!. Uerily the most honored of you in the sight of God is (he mho is) the most righteous of you.                           S&i
     find God has full knowledge and is mell acquainted ( with all things)
                                                                Holy Quran ---

 As far as inside is concerned this policy is out of date and does not suit the situation on the ground. This type of policy could have an effect when the confrontation is an internal problem, In the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan and a communist puppet regime these changes do not have any appeal to the majority of the people
 After more than seven years of war the people of Afghanistan are too politically aware to be decieved by names or blindly follow the decisions of some decieved tribal leaders The war has had its effect every where, including the tribal areas In the tribal areas although the tribal system still exists, the leadership has changed and the new leadership is more concious of their religious and national duties than some people guess
 It is also wrong to think that the whole Afghan community is ruled by tribal codes The Resistance is very strong deep inside the country The new dynamic leadership of the Resistance is much smarter than the puppets and even than the Godless Soviets themselves
 The Resistance in Afghanistan has a strong ideological base which should not be underestimated All the nationalities are pulled together by Islamic ideaiogy The Soviets are not in a position to disarm the the Resistance from their motives the liberation of Afghanistan and establishing an Islamic government Therefore all these efforts to change one puppet for another is doomed to failure People of Afghanistan know the real motives behind all these steps and can not be decieved A persian peom says
 Go and wear what color of clothes you like I recognize you from your style of walking
