Note From RACA Health Committee
The health and education of the Afghan are priorities for the Mujahideen leaders as they plan for reconstruction of Afghanistan. In both fields the major impediments to progress are cost, manpower, and baseline deficiencies which have not improved over the last ten years.
It has been estimated that
literacy in Afghanistan is below 30%, while for Afghan women it is below 3%. This is the worst of any country in the world.
Health indices show that out of 100 babies born in Afghanistan about 200 babies die before they reach one year old. (See box). In developed countries, less than 10 babies die out of every 100 born.
In spite of this high infant mortality rate in Afghanistan, the
population will double in about 30 years due to the high birth rate. Such a high doubling rate will put a very severe strain on the educational and health facilities as they are being rebuilt.
It is interesting to note that recent research has shown that education and health are linked. An improvement in education of a population will automatically provide for an improvement in that population's health as well.
