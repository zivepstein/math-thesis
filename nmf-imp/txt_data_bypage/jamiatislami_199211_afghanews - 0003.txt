Mass grave found in Herat
The discovery of a mass grave at Herat in Afghanistan on September 22 has weakened the belief of the relatives of thousands of missing Afghans who were thought to be alive and incarcerated in various states of the former Soviet Union.
It was reported that at least 2,000 Afghans have been dumped under several tonnes of mud by the former communist government in Kabul near the premises of the office used by the now-defunct People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
The recovered bodies were blindfolded and had their hands lied behind their back. The bodies reportedly bore bullet marks as well.
It is still not clear whether the executions were carried out in the days of He'" :ullah Amin or Prbrrk Karmal-tlie
two former Afghan Presidcnts-following the April coup of 1978. A UN team has also visited the site and has confirmed the discovery of the first mass grave.
A huge gathering of the people was held at the sight of mass grave. Men, women and children had attended the meeting. Ismail Khan, the commander and governor of Herat, told the mourners that they should not wait for the return of their relatives anymore.
He used the occasion to attack the communist regime and its local supporters who committed the crime. The gathering was the largest after the formation of the Islamic government in April.
To protest to the killing, people in Herat went to the rooftop of their house and chanted Allha-o-Akber (God is Great) one hour each night for one week. A mourning day was observed in Herat to respect those killed defending Islam and Afghanistan.

Man bites dog • that's news
Nasruddin had been out of town on one of his long hikes. As he entered the village he saw the people hurrying, one and all, towards the market-place. "Don’t you know? A man has been on the pilgrimage to Mecca. This year there were a hundred thousand people there - and'he is giving a lecture about it."
r "From the excitement." said Nasruddin, ’I had almost concluded that the pilgrimage had come to him-not the other way about"
Just as well I came along
'Jasruddin was walking past a well, when he had the imputse to look into it. It was night, and as he ^peered into the deep water, he saw the Moon's reflection there.
"I must save the Moon!" Nasruddin thought. "Otherwise she; will never wane, and the fasting month of Ramadan will never come to an end.'
He found a rope, threw it in and called down:'"Hold tight; keep bright; succor is at hand!"
the rope caught in a rock inside the well, and Nasruddin heaved as hard as he could. Straining back, he suddenly felt the rope give as it came loose, and he was thrown on his back. As he lay there, panting, he saw the Moon riding in the sky above.
"Glad to be of service," said Nasruddin. "Just, as well I came along wasn't it?"
