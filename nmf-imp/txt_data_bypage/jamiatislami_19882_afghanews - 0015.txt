 These types of stal emoid s by our Irani brothers are repeated now and then need some clarification from the Resistance side.
 It would be logical to deal with the most serious problems that Afghanistan is facing first and that is the occupation of this country by the Soviet Union and the suffering of millions of Afghans. Wien that phase of the struggle lias come to a.'-successful end then we must deal with the power (powers) who may try to spread their influence.
 Ve are thankful to our Irani brothers for their strong political support and allowing more than two million Afghan refugees to stay in Iran, hrut what has been done so far by them to deal with the present problem, forcing the soviets out of Afghanistan is far less than we expected and. much less than the situation requires from then.
 Iran who has been engaged in a war with Iraq, as long as we have been against the Soviets, knows better than anybody else the needs of a people who have to tight a war. If the war is waged by the ordinary people of one country against the army; of a $upei?pqw$r, the problem will be much bigger.
 Restriction of Hujahideen movements in Iran has created nasty problems for the Resistance and has put a negative effect on the overall military activities of the Mujahideen in the Vest and South-Vest of Afghanistan. Coverage of war by the Iranian press and
 electronic media is not adequate nor vary positive.
 Our Irani brothers know that the Resistance against the Soviet invaders in Afghanistan is a popular movement supported by the absolute majority of the Afghan people. Our people are muslins and want to get Afghanistan free from the Soviet occupation and then fora an Islamic government. Therefore, the whole struggle hinges around the key issues of independence from foreign domination and living according to the tenants of Islam,
 We assure brother Al:i Rafsanjam that we have the ability and the determination to oppose foreign influence. Once we              fought
 successfully against the British Empire , now we are fighting Soviet imperialism and If there is any other power to'spread its influence she will face our strong opposition.
 The main issue now is the influence and even the physical occupation of Islamic Afghanistan by Soviet Russia which we have to fight against. The sacred Islamic duty of our'muslin brothers is to help us in our dehail.
 The occupation of Afghanistan has not only created immense cultural, political and humanitarian problems for the Afghans but has also posed serious threats to flic neighboring countries and the region. Iran Is now surrounded from two directions, Horth and East by the Soviet Union which must worry our brothers in Iran, especially those in the very responsible positions in the.Islamic Republic.
 If the remarks of our Irani brothers about American influence in Afghanistan is a warning to the Afghans, it is understandable; but over-emphasising a potential danger (with very small possibilities) will draw world attention from the grave situation in Afghanistan towards secondary issues and .could be very useful for the Soviets.
