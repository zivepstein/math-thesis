workshops, vocational classes, a school and a day-care centre for 200 children. What has particularly attracted the malevolence of the Israelis is its efforts to keep alive the Palestinian sense of identity through teaching of folklore and handicrafts Five vocational courses open to women provide teaching in sewing, machine knitting, machine embroidery, cosmetics and secretarial training. An annual bazar enables the women to market
their products. There is also an orphanage (Dar alYatama), with 150 inmates accommodated in two buildings.
One afternoon on June 8. a group of Israeli policemen simply walked in and closed most of the society down for a period of two years'.
The real reasons for Israel's closure of In ash al-Usrah is not far to seek, it is part to Israel's policy of collective punishment, of making all Arabs corporately
responsible for the activities of those engaged in active resistance A society like In'ash al-Usrah. by paying for the education of martyrs' families, is helping to keep the spirit of resistance alive' even anything so innocuous as folklore or embroidery is a target for Israeli brutality as such activities help nourish in a demoralised people the spirit of resistance by reminding them of their identity and a past in which they can take legitimate pride -

SCORCHED RY QAXRAIIAR"
The following article had been published by Panda on August 10th, I9SR, which clearly speaks of Russians' convulsiveness and agitations. The article had been written by V. Okulov and P. Studenikin, Pravda's special correspondents.
Qandahar, we flew here before daybreak The airport on the "edge" of the Registan desert looked lifeless. Afghan soldiers stood next to our armoured carriers (the Soviet troops' base had virtually been handed over to the Afghan Army Corps). Our rear military personnel had been flying out of Qandahar day after day. Only the combat subunits remained. They had to leave for the border along a route that skirted Afghanistan in a semicircle from the South-from Qandahar-to the Northern through Shindand.
"Your departure from Qandahar at the first stage of implementing the Geneva agreements is well timed", many Afghans in Kabul and Qandahar

said to us. This exposes true aims of the Peshawar leaders propaganda trump cards
The situation in Qandahar, which has always been complicated,	remains
contradictory even now. According to information from competent Afghan organs, there are 389 groups in the province -more than 17,000 men Less
than 200 of them are active -numbering 11.000 men As everywhere in AFghanistan, when the implementation of the Geneva Accords began, the process of polarization of forces increased in the opposition i camp and disagreements were exacerbated to the point of vicious fighting.
