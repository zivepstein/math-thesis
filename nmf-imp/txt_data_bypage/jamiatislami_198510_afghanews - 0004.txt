   When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and installed a puppet regime in Kabul, the seat of Afghanistan in the U.N was also occupied by their puppets.
   The Afghan people started their struggle for the liberation of their country this had continued for five years. The Resistance now controls more than 80 °/o of the land and the absolute majority of the. population. The control of the occupationist'force and their puppets is minor and inef f e-ctive .
   It is reasonable and just that the Resistance which is the. representative of the people and has control of the land, should represent the Afghan nation, not a puppet regime which is kept:in Kabul and some other cities by about 200,000 foriegn troops. The time has come to demand our rights and win back the seat of Afghanistan in the United Nations.
