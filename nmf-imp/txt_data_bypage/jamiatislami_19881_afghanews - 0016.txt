  The oppressed Palestinian people should stand by us rather than by the Soviet in vaders •who have always played a double game in the Middle East
  One thing is clear: that is the overwhelming majority support of the Arab masses for our cause, The bonds of faith and brotherhood are so strong that it could not be affected • by the short-sighted, even ua-Islamic. policies of some leaders.
  When Mujahideen leaders ask these officials why they do not take sides with the Mujahideen and the people of Afghanistan, and condemn the invasion,, they give . strange answers. Some say, 'our hearts are with you*, and others talk about open and secret positions',
  The Soviets in Afghanistan, and Israel in Palestine, have made use of these divisions to continue their occupations, If &00 million Muslims were true Muslims and if they were united to defend each other against aggression, the Soviets would not have dared to invade Afghanistan. If the Muslim world had stood firm behind the Afghans and had net divided themselves, the occupation of Afghanistan would not have lasted so long.
