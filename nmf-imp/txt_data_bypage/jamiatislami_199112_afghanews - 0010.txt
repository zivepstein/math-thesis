Afghan veterans defend democracy
Afghan veterans, known as Afghanskis, played a vital role in the defeat of hardliners' August coup in Moscow. They defended the Russian Parliament, and one of the three men crushed by a Red Army tank was an Afghanski.
Afghanskis who have suffered from Moscow's Afghan adventure bitterly opposed . the attempt to keep Soviet society from moving towards democracy.
The Afghanskis' organisation is more developed in Uzbekistan than other parts of the Soviet Union. Islam Karimov, the president of Uzbekistan, has given them a lot of attention.
Afghanskis, who suffer from lack of attention from the people, sometimes try to keep their cause alive by opening shops which are named after Afghanistan.
The coup's failure made it possible for AFGHANews to be mailed directly to Soviet readers. A Soviet journalist, an Afghanski and the Social Democratic Party are on the mailing list of the paper. In the past, some Soviet writers received AFGHANews through Mujahideen supporters in Sweden.
