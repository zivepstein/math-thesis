                   A CROP OF DREAMS ( in Memoriam:    Khalili, the Poet of Afghan Resistence.)
          The blinding night
          Covering the twisted mountain path.
          The tall fir trees
          Engulfed by the dark roaring winds.
          The arrogant peaks
          Pitched against a thundering snowstorm.
  Down in the valley
  A stream in flood, swelling steadily. - The wooden bridge has just come down. The passing caravan is in a disarray. The fallen pony had a three year old Nested on top of its load.
Mothers, like poets.
Plant dreams in the heart of history. The drowned three year old Is a dream now;
The dream of freedom.
The mountain stream will ever flow In the heart of the wailing mother. Deeper and deeper.
           In this war
           Pitched against a deadly oppressor Is a crop of dreams.
           The dreams of mothers.
           Mighty sons! fight on.
           The day is not far
           When the blinding night will grumble.
           Dreams are stronger than death.
                                                                          Mohammad A. Adeel
* The allusion is to the Biblical line ‘Love is stronger than death’ .
