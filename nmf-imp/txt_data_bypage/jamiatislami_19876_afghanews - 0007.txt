                                 RELIGION IN THE SERVICE OF COMMUNISM
 Communists do not believe in God and consider religion to be the remains of backward societies so they want to destroy it Communist harsh measures against Islamic teachings and religious figures which started with the communist coup of 1978 in Afghanistan revealed the enmity of Afghan communists towards religion.
 Communists found Islam a major obstacle on their way to impose an alien way of life on Afghans who were Muslims, so they declared a total war against it Their harsh measure were not able to subdue the popular resistance and even the intervention of the Red Army could not help the situation After seven years of military pressure the war lords in Moscow and their puppets in Kabul try to adopt a new tactic -that is. to destroy Islam with Islam                                                                       ,
 The easiest target for their campaign was the common man who has a shallow understanding of Islam Communists thought that by talking about religion white washing the mosques and participating in congregational prayers, they could win the-hearts and minds of the people and give the impression that the regime respects Islam. This explains the purpose of all religions propaganda launched by the regime
 Holy Quran is recited each morning on the state controlled radio, mosques are whit-washed Imams of the mosques are paid a salary and the ministry of religious affairs have been established
 After the national reconciliation program the religious propaganda launched by the regime has been intensified. Najib quoted the verses of Holy Quran to justify his policies participated in recitation of Holy Quran during Ramadhan nights and release some prisoners on the occasion of the beginning of Ramadhan
 The regime has recently announced the opening of the of an Islamic research center in Kabul University During the time of the King Zahir Shah the foundation stone of such a center was laid by king Faisal in the University campus Zahir Shah under the pressure from the Soviets abandoned the idea Now the puppet regime wants to use it
 for its political purposes
 Recently it was announced by the puppet regime that an international Qera'at (Holy Quran recitation) will be held in Kabul during the montl\ of Ramadhan It is possible that people from so-called progressive countries like USSR, Syria, Libya, South Yemen and India will participate in this religious program to give the regime credit The puppet regime has put a lot of hope in these efforts to deceive the people of Afghanistan and cover up its anli-Islamic nature But all the evidence shows that they will not succeed in achieving their evil aims because of the following reasons
    1- People now are more aware of the nature of communists than the past They have seen and even experienced the atrocities of communists (puppet and Soviets). They witnessed the destruction of villages, burning the Holy Book and degradation of the mosques by the communists
    2- Mujahideen who have the support of religious scholars will continue to remind the people of their responsibilities and will expose the designsof the communists
    .V History of communist s attitudes towards Islam prevents any sort of premature thinking ahout co-existence of Islam with communism Central Asia once the center of propagation of Islam was destroyed by communists for ever The people of Afghanistan remember what happened to Islam and Muslims in Central Asia They remember how they destroyed the religious institutions of Muslims by similar tactics to which they are practicing now in Afghanistan
 Puppets efforts to wear a religions mask to destroy Jehad is doomed to failure
