Who is who in the Mujahideen
Martyr Safiullah Afzali
In 1954, Safiullah Afzali was born into a re-igious family residing in Qaysan Village located in the District of Ghooryan in the Province of Herat. Afzali spent his childhood in his native village and attended the local primary school.
Later he attended high school in Herat and after his graduation went to study at Kabul University. In 1971, he joined the Islamic Movement. His brother Hafizullah Afzali participated in the 1975 Panjshir Uprising and was captured and later killed. This consolidated Safiullah's dedication against the regime.
After the Communist Coup of 1978, he was arrested and placed in prison for a short period of time. Following Afzali's release from prison, he travelled back to Herat to join the uprising against the Taraki regime. Initially the people met success in the uprising by capturing the Zalmay Koot Division of the regime forces, but this led to heavy reinforcement forces being called to Herat which led to destructive bombing of the city by the regime's air force. As a result of the fighting about 20,000 people died. Afzali was active in the fighting against the regime forces.
After the defeat, the Mujahideen maintained their morale and some
members organized themselves into guerilla units. Afzali became a leader of such a group whose membership mainly included other young educated men. He appealed to the people around him as a charismatic young leader. His group took the name "The Martyred Hafizullah Afzali Front" and was mainly active around the city of Herat and some nearby districts.
Afzali worked closely with other Jami'at commanders who had appointed Ismael Khan as their Commander in Chief. There were some differences between Ismael Khan and Afzali regarding how to fight the enemy, but these were kept to a level which did not prevent them from cooperating with each other.
Some people tried to exploit these small differences for their own political gains. Once, Afzali in conversing with a friend stated that there were no real problems between him and Commander Ismael Khan.
On the seventh of July, 1987, Afzali was ambushed and murdered by KHAD agents while travelling on the highway between Tayebat and Turbat in Iran.
Many thousands of people attended his funeral. Afzali became the fourth son of his surviving father of 95 years to have been killed by the regime forces. His brother Captain Azizullah was later appointed as the commander of his Mujahideen group. His widow is active amongst Jami'at women in Iran by participating in seminars and holding public meetings.
Teacher kills his 12-year old Afghan refugee student
A 12-year old Afghan refugee student was killed in Iran on November 29 when his teacher physically punished him for laughing in the classroom.
Wahidullah Afzali, a student of Zhandah Peel Primary School of Turbat in Khurasan province, was kicked by his teacher and he died after reaching hospital in Mashed.
The teacher, Husaini, who is an Iranian has beat arrested by police and a case has been registered against him.
An official of the education authority in Turbat told the Daily Khurasan that the law prohibits physical punishment in Iranian schools and if it is proved that the teacher has kicked the
student he will punished by law.
Wahidullah Afzali is die nephew of Safiullah Afzali a famous commander from Herat who was assassinated in Iran two years ago.
Iranian papers had reported the arrest of those involved in the assassination. They had carried out the attack with direction from KHAD, the Kabul regime secret police. Afzali's family wanted the suspects to be tried in a revolutionary court because of the political nature of the murder, but the Iranian authorities wanted them to be tried in ordinary court
Wahidulla's father believes that there is a political motive behind the tragic incident in which his son lost his life.
