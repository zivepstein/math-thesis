     We do not understand how the West cm be fooled by Mikhail Gorbachev. It is true that he seems friendly. But under that smiling face is the iron claw of the bear. Since Gorbachev came to power, atrocities have increased, terrorism and border violations in Pakistan have dramatically risen. Soviet Spetsnaz troops (special forces) are now launching nightime assaults with greater effectiveness along the border of Pakistan. Getting supplies though is more difficult. Do not let the smiling Grbachev fool you. He is responsible for the burning to death of innocent Afghan children, the use of toy bombs which maim them for life and the Sovietization of our country by the kidnapping of children for Communist indoctrination in the Soviet Union. But Gorbachev has not broken our will— he has only strengthened it.              «
     We find it hard to understand why there is so little media coverage here of this war. 1 was told that last year less than one . hour of national TV news coverage was given to Afghanistan in this country. Tet we have seen many journalists come through our offices in Pakistan en route to Afghanistan. And we have seen them come out with very'good film footage.
     How is the world to know of our struggle if they are not shown and not told? Can we afford ignorance when our nation is in the throws of being destroyed. More than 1.5 million have been killed, 5 million are exiles and an additional 2 million are internal refugees. Everyone has been touched directly by the war and nearly every Afghan supports our cause. It is true national liberation movement, one the Soviets would be envious of.
     The key to any solution is the existence of a stronger resistance. The resistance will become stronger if it is given more appropriate material help.
     I would like to conclude by reading to you a letter from a very famous commander.
