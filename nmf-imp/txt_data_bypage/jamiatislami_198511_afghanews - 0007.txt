                       U.N_DEBATE_A_BIG_VICTORY
     The United Nation General Assembly passed a resolution which, called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. The resolution was passed by 122 in favour which is a record for the past 6 years.
     The only weak point of the resolution was the absence of the Soviet Union's name as the foreign intervening force.
     We believe that no natter how soft the wording of the resolution was, the Soviets will reject it as they have done during the past 6 years. On the other hand a soft resolution will not put enough pressure on the Soviets to revise their policies in Afghanistan.
     What the Soviets are doing in Afghanistan is not a minor mistake.
     They are busy destroying a country and ruining a culture. They deserve to be called aggressors and this is the name they have gained throught their actions.
     If we do not name the Soviets as invaders they take it as a sign of weakness and try to exploit it . The peace-loving and free world*people is expected to be bold, honest and just in all its decisions. Every body including the Soviets themselves know that they are invaders. Let us call then by their true names.
                         A _TWO __ PRONGED _PO LI'CY
     While the Soviets final aim is the pacification of Afghanistan,their tactics vary from time to time.
     Mujahideen sources have found that, now the Soviets are working on a two pronged policy against the Mujahideen,,
     1- They want to establish garrisons at district and aub-district level. From there, they will carry on their political and military work in
     the countryside.
     2- They wants to disturbs the logistic lines of the Mujahideen. They will do this by direct military or subversive means.
     They have started their works in these two directions and it is expected that after the winter their activities will intensify^

     There is a great deal of publicity concerning foreign aid for the Mujahideen. Some papers talk of several hundred million Dollars worth of arms being sent to them . But facts on the ground show that there is no change in the quality of weapons which the Mujahideen are using and there is still a shortage not only of arms but ammunition as well. On the other hand the Soviets are introducing new weapons and pouring ing in more troops.
