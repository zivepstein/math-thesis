AFGHANISTAN IN 1987
    The year 1987 was a special year as far as the Russo-Afghan war is concerned The I   enemy s political initiative strengthened the political dimension of the war The armed [
 |  struggle of the Afghan people against the Soviet invaders continued and the
 I  Mujahideen scored some major victories In the political field, despite the enemy’s.    t
 !  massive propaganda, world public opinion was not deceived The world community          j
    continued to ask the Soviets to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan and let the . people of that country decide their future Soviet leaders seem hesitant to take.proper - j steps to solve the problem of Afghanistan The Afghans do not see a light at the end of j the tunnel                                                                          {

    MILITARY SITUATION
    Intensive fighting continued along the Eastern, and Southern borders of Afghanistan, i
    Military activities along the Western borders of Afghanistan were considerable too The i   enemy launched attacks to secure its bases in the area and cut the supply routes of the
 S  Mujahideen Mujahideen tried to keep the supply routes open and carry out a war of
    attrition against the enemy bases, The enemy failed to cut the supply routes of the    j
    Mujahideen but due to the nature of land which is flat, the enemy could create some    j
    problems for the security of the routes. By carrying out military operations along the borders, the enemy also wanted to show to the world that the war against it is from the i neighboring country not from within Afghanistan itself.
 ;  Offensives were also launched in other parts of Afghanistan. One such an attack was
 j' launched in Kunduz at the beginning of the year in retaliation to some rocket shots    j
 |  inside the Soviet Union by the Mujahideen As a result, a large number of civilians     j
    were killed by bombs or were massacred by enemy commando units, A similar attack is    i
    continuing at the moment in the same area.
    War activities of the enemy remained confined vithin the borders of Afghanistan j   Refugee camps and villages in Pakistan were bombed by the enemy air force and          \
    artillery and bombs were exploded in the cities, Consequently, a large number of       j
    refugees and their Pakistani hosts lost their lives The main purpose of the enemy      j
 !  from all these overt and covert activities is to create friction between the Pakistan  ;
 !  people and Afghan                               Refugees.                              I
 !                                                                                         j
 ; The morale of the enemy troops is low and desertion of the puppet troops has : j continued The puppet army remains dependent on Soviet support more than the past.
 f                                                                                         '
    The year 1987 was a relative good year for the Mujahideen With the improvement of 1
 | air defense capabilities of the Mujahideen, both the fighters and the civilians are j
    feeling safer As a result of this development the morale of the enemy air force has
    declined and has put a negative effect on the over all fighting abilities of the enemy
    During the current year, the Mujahideen repulsed all the major enemy attacks. A new positive development on the Mujahideen side was the successive victories they scored in the war against the DRA garrisons. Attacks against the enemy garrisons were well planned and the Mujahideen from different provinces participate in them. The idea of launching a co-ordinated attack is being developed
