A. I believe Najib’s proposals are all useless and nonsense. He hopes to fool the ▼orld and to pretend that his government has been stabilized. He pretends that there has been a shift in policy and he vents to share pover ▼ith others. But in my mind these are all lies. First of ail, Najib is only a puppet and does not have any freedom of choice. Secondly, he does not have any pover and authority in Afghanistan Thirdly, the Russians ▼ill never give him permission to form a government ▼hich is not under the domination of the communistsFourthiy, and more important than all above, even if Najib could fulfil his proposals - ▼hich he cannot- the Mujahideen will never join him. It is obvious that Najib and his band are agents and murderers. The Mujahideen vrill never join vith charlatans and murderers of their nation.

 $Mn his propaganda, did he have in mind the Mujahideen leaders?
 I believe his propaganda is aimed at attracting those groups ▼hich are not part of the government but do not have any decisive position against Russians either. His target is the non-Parchami and non-Khalqi communist individuals and groups such as Setam-i-miili, Shuia-i-Javaid, and Afghan Millat.
 Q. The Khalqis ▼ho have run avay ... they as well?
 A. Probably.
 Q. In the government in ▼hich you participate in the future, can the members of the "Democratic Government’ be included?
