Eng. Hekmatyar’s visit to Qandahar
We left for Quetta a week before Engineer Gulbudin Hekmatyar, Amir Hczb-i-Islami Afghanistan, had reached there. We decided that we would be accompanying him not as reporters but as Mujahids in this risky and hazardous trip to Qandahar and Zabul provinces. We had already been told that Mr. Hekmatyar would be in Quetta by August 28 around 3:00 p.m. Upon his arrival we left for Ala Jirgah, across the Pak Afghan border in the Zabul province. After six hours's speedy drive we arrived at the HlA's militaiy brigade in Ala Jirgah, named Mubarez Ghound (Valiant Brigade). Despite

' Eng. Hekmatyar in a meeting with Mujahideen’s Commanders in Arghasoo of Mizani, subdistrict of Zabul province.
the night time we were received with open arms by the brigade commander, Lieutenant Muzafaruddin Khan’s men, who is known for his chivalry and total commitment to Jihad.
After have dinner and tea I came out of the room to watch the starry sky and things surrounding the brigade. In the calm atmosphere the memory of a risky trip to khost (a border town in the Paktia province in October 1986) flashed across
my mind when we had much difficulty in finding our way.
The next, morning we were joined by representatives of 21 provinces to see for ourselves the passion of the Qandaharis for the establishment of a truely Islamic government We also had a chance to glance at the visual display of unity, unanmity and sense of cooperation which stripingly featured the Mujahideen of various groups. We stayed for two nights.
