After a day of rest in Peryan we were told by the commander of the area, Najmuddin, to prepare ourselves for a trip to Worsaj to meet commander Masood there We chose Anjuman route because the other routes which passed through Kotal Zard (yellow pass) was still blocked for the horses. In the morning of July 27th we crossed Anjuman pass. The pass was covered with snow which was still falling On the way to Anjuman village, we passed through Anjuman lake which provided a good scene to photograph Around noon we arrived at Anjuman village which was totally destroyed This village of about 100 houses was razed to the ground in 1984 during the Panjshir 7th offensive The people of the area now live in small houses which they have made beside the big rock. There was a shop in the village
The next day we climbed Wishti pass and entered Worsaj valley All along the route hundreds of donkeys and horses were transporting necessity goods like ghee, sugar.
