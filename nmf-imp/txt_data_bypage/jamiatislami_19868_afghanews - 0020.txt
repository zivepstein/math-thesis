 There are thousands of campaigns to be won and hundreds of places to show who is more revolutionary . There is no need for revolutionary talks when there is ground for revolutionary action. There arc 150,000 Soviet soidiers, thousands of tanks and hundreds of Helicopters in Afghanistan. There is a-chance for every body , big or small to show to the world and the people of Afghanistan who he is and what he does.
 May Allah lead us all to the right path.
 During his visit of Valadivostok in the far east, Gorbachev announced that 6 , regiments of the Red Army wilt leave Afghanistan before the end of the current year. He announced this on the eve of the Geneva seventh round of proximity talks. Some circles welcomed the move and others called it too small.
 The spokesman of the Mujahideen Alliance, Prof. Mujededi called it a propaganda step with no real intention to withdraw.
 If we look -at the seven years of war in Afghanistan,the Soviets have increased their troops considerably,in the past they had announced that they would take some troops out of Afghanistan but never mentioned replacing them with new troops. At the beginning of the invasion the Soviets Had brought very heavy tanks which could not be used in Afghanistan. They replaced them with lighter tanks and called it withdrawal of their troops.
 According to a report by Mujahideen of Badakhshan the Soviets have brought several thousand fresh troops to Badakhshan. TheSoviet Army also rotates ns units regularly bringing in new ones to replace the old.
 If there is any truth in withdrawing some of the units it could be a rotational process. The Withdrawing of two AA regiments is hardly a sign of improvement because no air force is threatening the Soviets and their
 puppets.
 The reality of the situation is not that the Soviets are able to decrease the number of their troops but that they need more troops to achieve their aim, the military solution ,
 The announcement also intended to show that the puppet regime is stronger than before . But demanding four years for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in the proximity talks reveals its actual weakness.
 From all the above reasons it seems that the Soviet leader s announcement of a reduction of troops is not an honest gesture and does not show any change in policy, it is propaganda to fool the world and decrease pressure from the Soviets who are busy killing the people of Afghanistan and destroying its culture and enconomy.The Soviets seem determined to win the war by military means so the announcement of the reduction of forces is a ploy.
