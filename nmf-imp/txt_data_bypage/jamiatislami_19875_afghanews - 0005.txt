Take the "Expressen', for example, which does not publish a requested article on the Soviet bomb terror ia Pakistan on the plea that "it does not seem timely.".
Take the Dagens Nyheter which has refused a number of topical articles on Afghanistan, and where, after the Afghan traitor Najib's overture for an armistice and reconciliation, an editorial urged the Afghan resistance movement to lay down their arms, and where, since then there have been no comments whatsoever on the Soviet bomb attack on Pakistani territory which claimed about a hundred human lives and which were carried out simultaneously with the start of the Geneva talks on Afghanistan.

This, of course, is the ultimate critical test whether the man is serious in his talk about peace and freedom. The blood in Afghanistan stands out in glaring contrast to the light-colored picture.
Certainly we should ourselves hope. We have not, as the old poet Khalilullah Khalili, seen our country being rapped and our people slaughtered, so we can dare to hope. But let us not even just hope, because then we do the grossest disservice both to ourselves and to the people of Afghanistan. Let us realize that the old poet Khalilullah Khalili is right when he says the only possibility is to continue fighting
He is right because the army of occupation is still standing with its legs wide apart on the soil of Afghanistan, because the Soviet leadership is continuing its war of terror against the Afghan people in contravention of international law.
He is right because so far the Geneva talks on Afghanistan have not produced a reasonable time-table for a the withdrawal of the troops and much less a guarantee for the restoration of the national sovereignty of Afghanistan._________________________
