      AS part of the IUaM s j program, prof. 8. Rabbani. the I leader of jami at fslami } Afghanistan, spoke at a large i gathering of Afghan refugees | in Khurasan camp at the outskirts of Peshawar an April 27. The meeting was held to condemn the April communist coup of 197S in Kabul.
      in his speacli, Prof. Rabbani addressed many issues that the Resistance is facing. Here are highlights of Prol, Rabbani s speech:
      •The April coup not only brought a bunch of criminals to power but marked the beginning of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and j an attempt to annex i Afghanistan to the Russian 1 empire. The plot, however.
 ; failed because of the Afghan : peoples heroic resistance.
      •       We condemn the Geneva ■ accord but congratulate our ! Mujahid people for theif
   victory in forcing the Russians out of Afghanistan. The Russians do not withdraw their troops as a result of the Geneva talks, but because of the heroic struggle of the Afghan Mujahideen,
      •       Among the contradictory j reactions to the Geneva accord
   and pessimism and optimism expressed, two facts are forgotten in regard of the j accord:
      (a)     The decisive victory of the Afghan nation over the
 | Russian invaders. This I victory is certainly the greatest phenomenon of our age.
      (b) The lack of
 * condemnation of Russia for its barbaric attack and brutal atrocities. The lack of such a condemnation is indeed the most unfortunate event in history. It sets an evil precedent for other invaders
  in the future.
     •   The recent retreats of the puppet regime s troops following the news of a possible Russian troop withdrawal is clear evidence of the regime's emptiness and lack of support among the people.
     Naiib s recent proposal for de-mi litari2ed zones is a desperate cover over its imminent downfall. We categorically reject the deceitful proposal and announce that until the complete liberation of Afghanistan from the Russians and their agents no part of the country can be considered a zone of peace,"
     •   The Geneva Accord does not bring peace to Afghanistan. Foreign aggression stilt continues in the country. Until the Russian puppet regime is removed: aggression is not ended, peace cannot be restored, and the refugees will not be able to return.
     •   There should not be any fear from the establishment of an Islamic government in Afghanistan. Anyone who fears a Mujahideen government, actually fears the government of the Afghan people, if there is such a fear in the West, it means that those who hold such views do not adhere to their own democratic principles and do not recognize the right of self-determination for other nations.
     •    ft is absolutely wrong to think that there are deep differences among Mujahideen and that Afghanistan would become another Lebanon. In the near future, the world
  ! will witness greater unity among Mujahideen.
     •   Signing Geneva Accord has not eliminated the need
 I
 for direct talks between the I Russians and the Mujahideen. There are many Issues that could be discussed.
    If Russians hope for friendship with the Afghan people, they must respect the wifi of the nation, recognize the Mujahideen government, stop interfering in our domestic affairs, and compensate lor their historical crime in invading Afghanistan.
    •    Prof. Rabbani disclosed that the Russians had approached the Mujahideen through some Muslim personalities. They had expressed willingness to have good relations with the Alghan people and readiness to recognize a Mujahideen government. He said If the Russians are sincere, they must publicly announce what they have been saying in their private letters.
    •    Prof. Rabbani expressed bis regret and resentment about the "congratulations messages' sent by some Muslim leaders to Najib. Some countries have even shown readiness to provide massive aid to the puppet regime.
       • The Jami at leader assured the Afghan intellectuals and the Afghan j women that they will play a j major role in the future in Afghanistan. The propaganda which says Mujahideen will close schools and lock up women is totally baseless.
     •     Prof. Rabbani welcomed the Islamic uprising among the Palestinians against the Zionist tyranny. He said the Palestinian people are discovering their natural way for victory. He asked the Arab and other Muslim nations to support the Palestinian cause and not to leave their brothers alone.
