Dear Editor:
The efforts of Engineer Hekma-tyar as the spokesman of Ittehad-i-lslami Mujahideen Afghanistan at the United Nations for the deliverance of the Afghan seat to the sole representative of the Afghan nation and his declaration of a General Amnesty are major steps in the present stage of the Afghan Jehad.
As a result of this general amnesty four army generals, scores
of soldiers from different parts of the country, and more than 650 armed Afghan soldiers in Ghazni province have joined the ranks of the Mujahideen.
I am sure such steps will fill the gap which exists between the military and political aspects of the Afghan Jehad.
Your brother Abu Mansoor Islamabad
