Letters to the Editor
I have been reading your esteemed magazine form the past one year since my joining service as a clerk in Gomal University D. I. Khan. While reading this magazine I break into tears and my heart laments for the tragedy which has befallen on this proud and honourable nation. The way you express and offer solutions to the present problems confronted by the “Muslim Ummah” is also appreaciable. I am sure that one day your voice would reach everywhere throughout the world.
Actually all these problems can be solved with firm determination of mind and heart. The help which is extending your magazine towards "Mujahideen" emboldens my faith that one day the efforts of Mujahideen will bring fruitful results. Insha Allah.

We are thankful to you for your letter and appreciate your keen interest in The Mujahideen Magazine. We also offer you the pages of this magazine if you want to write articles on the different issues confronting Muslim Ummah. ...Editor

Dear Sir,
I am a regular reader of The Mujahideen. There is hardly any time which I read your magazine that 'am not filled with happiness in that I see better and it seems I know why Imperialists would generally not allow any Muslim nation to stand on its feet and would go at any length in blackmailing and destroying those so called Islamic Fundamentalists in Western ideological terminologies. My aim is to inquire if people like us here in Africa could reproduce some of your articles in our local Newspapers and journals so as to extend the circum ference of benefit to others too.	.	•
May Allah bless you and guide us all

Therefore we are not only permitting you to reroduce those articles you feel are necessary but also emphasising to you that such duties arc obligatory in faith.
