kill men, but they are massacring women, children and old people as well.
Although such savage terror is prohibited for the army and it is unbearable, such brutal behavior of the Russian soldiers is rewarded by Russian officers of the bloodsucking Red Army. Thus the Russian officers want to force their soldiers to do and launch such savage operations, and thus a lot of Russian soldiers have been losing their lives as the people fight back.
Those houses and villages which show even little resistance have come under the heavy and barbaric fire, shelling and bombing, of Russian tanks and helicopters. Farms and crops are being set on fire and cattle killed. This way they are trying to bring about famine and under such a situation people either have to die of hunger or take refuge in the neighbouring countries.
The civilians love and respect the Mujahideen a lot. What the people desire is to voluntarily face the Russian armed forces with all the equipment they have at hand. This is their greatest bravery and that is all.
These people are fighting against these bloodthirsty Russian forces with their lives and wealth, not only the young and the strong men have taken up arms, but their women and children have also taken up arms against the enemy.
Right now when I am busy with my writing a young boy, Wali Gul, 14, is sitting near me and he is carrying a rifle which is difficult for him to carry. He with his other brothers is following this long way, which is difficult even for quite strong people. He like
other young fellows is ready all the time to fight and defend his country against those bloodthirsty Russian soldiers who deprived them of their childhood blessings.
Even if the Russians want to

modernise and uplift the life of the people, the social imperialism of Russia will only bring them the gifts of debauchery, drugs and alcoholism, which is the logical result of Marxism-Leninism.
