Arms deliveries to Kabul, 1989-91
By: David C.Isby
Since the Limited Contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan completed its withdrawal on 15 February, 1989, Soviet military involvement in the Afghan war has continued. One of the most significant military tools of Soviet policy in Afghanistan in 1989-91 has been the supply of arms and other aid to the Kabul regime.
One of the many paradoxes of the 1989-91 period in Soviet policy towards Afghanistan is that the massive supplies of Soviet weapons and supplies have been, in part, made possible by the overall reduction in the Soviet Army, including the withdrawal of forces from central Europe and Mongolia. Older Soviet equipment — some of which is probably already fully amortized in cost — has been made available for transfer to Afghanistan or, more commonly, has "cascaded" down into Soviet strategic equipment reserve stocks, which releases it for transfer. The shrinking chances of conflict in Europe may have also made the Soviets more ready to transfer expendable items from their stockpiles to be used in Afghanistan.
Soviet sources have explicitly justified this policy by saying that sending weapons to Afghanistan is cheaper than scrapping them, and that much of the equipment supplied was at the end of its service life.sFor example, the Soviets have claimed that some of the MiG-21, Su-17 and Su-22M fighter-bombers supplied were at over 150% of their service life, and so due to be retired from Soviet service.
The provision not only of military hardware, but of petroleum, oil, and lubricants by die Soviets — products which could otherwise have been sold .on the world market - has enabled die Kabul regime to continue combat operations. For example, the intense Afghan air force strikes that may well have turned the tide of battle at Jalalabad in 1989 would not have been possible without Soviet re-supply. A angle fighter-bomber can consume over 20 tons of expendables - chiefly bombs and fuel - in a single day, which increases their need for rapid resupply.
Arms supplies 1989-91
The supply of Soviet weapons has been vital in maintaining die Kabul regime. In the words of General Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander-in-Chief of US Central Command before the Senate Armed Services Committee on 8 February, 1990: "Just an unbelievable amount of modem Soviet equipment is flowing into Afghanistan. Ever since they left, they have been putting a lot in, but recently we have been seeing just an unbelievable amount of modem equipment"
In die period from early March to
mid-July 1989, the Soviets delivered 160 T-55 and T-62 tanks and 615 armored personnel carriers; in the February-December,
1988	period they had supplied 275 tanks, 300 BMP combat vehicles and 350 armored personnel carriers and other armored vehicles. In the first three months of 1990 165 T-54, T-55, and T-62 tanks, 240 armored personnel carriers, and 150 artillery pieces were among the weapons supplied. Reportedly enough MiG-21 Fishbeds and Su-17 Fitters were supplied to allow Kabul to retire most of its war-weary pre-1989 force.
As significant as the quantity of Soviet-supplied weapons has been the quality, including weapons systems never before exported, or sent only to choice clients: BM-22 220mm multiple rocket launchers, BMP-2 30mm armored infantry fighting vehicles, BTR-80 armored personnel carriers, 2S9 120mm SP mortars, SA-13 SP surface-to-air missiles, and Su-22M-4 Fitter-G fighter-bombers. There are reports of MiG-29 Fulcrums being supplied, although this has neither been confirmed nor supported by open-source photographs. One former pilot, however, who joined the resistance after the abortive 1990 coup attempt in Kabul, reports seeing three MiG-29s there.
In many cases, these are not export models, but weapons systems used by the Soviets themselves. Many of them had been used by the Soviets in Afghanistan: faded Soviet insignia was still visible on some BMP-2s in Kabul in December, 1990. Along with the extensive Soviet logistics, communications, and support networks and their contents, these weapons were handed over in place in 1988-89.
Putting a dollar value on any Soviet military activity is an imprecise-art. But total Soviet support to Kabul has been estimated by US and Pakistani sources as about 4 - 4.5 billion dollars in 1989 alone, of which 3.0-3.6 billion were military. In 1990, it appears that the same level of effort was sustained, despite reports of cutbacks.
Deliveries of FROG and SCUD missiles
The R-17 and R-300 SS-1 Scud SSM and the Luna-M FROG-7 rocket are the most notable weapons systems supplied by the Soviets to the Kabul regime since die withdrawal. The Scuds - which first went into action in October, 1988 - were made available for shipment by the reduction in Soviet forces in Central Europe.
By April 1990, 1,700 SCUD missiles had been delivered to Afghanistan, and 1,400 had been fired. Between January,
1989	and the end of April 1991, a total of 1,554 Scuds had been fired in Afghanistan: more than twenty times the 68 fired in the Gulf War.
Most of the Scuds were fired soon after they arrived, minimizing the vulnerability of stored missiles to resistance attack. It is obvious that the bulky missiles, support equipment, and liquid fuel have made up a
large part of the Soviet airlift effort. Because it is believed that there are only about 12 SCUD Transporter Erector Launchers in Afghanistan — eight near Kabul land four near Mazar-i-Sharif — it is likely that these have had to be replaced or overhauled repeatedly.
Other Soviet aid
Soviet sources, while admitting that the aid totals are difficult to track, tally Soviet assistance to Afghanistan in 1990 at almost two billion rubles. An additional $300 million in hard currency grants was also announced in 1990. The Soviets and tile Kabul regime report that economic aid declined from an annual level of 500 million rubles in 1988 to 120, then 50 million rubles in 1990-1, though this was supplemented by both US-dollar and soft-currency loans. As Najibullah himself has pointed out, 88% of his regime's budget is spent on the war, so even this civil-sector govemment-to-govemment aid will contribute to Kabul's war-fighting potential. While the official ruble total for 1991 aid is 400 million, with 40 million of that allocated for the defense of Kabul airport and the Salang Pass highway, some Soviet sources believe the aid total for 1991 will be about two billion rubles, including, for the first time, aid to the private sector.
In-kind deliveries supposedly were divided equally between food, fuel, and other commodities. 280,000 tonnes of wheat were to be supplied in 1990, but this was increased to 400,000 tonnes in August.
100.000	tonnes of sugar were also supplied. Fuel was to include 450,000 tonnes, including 110,000 tonnes of jet fuel. Kabul requested that total jet fuel be increased to
160.000	tonnes for 1990. Other nonmilitary in-kind aid ranged from airliners to agricultural machinery. As with Kalashnikovs, a percentage of in-ltind aid -- up to a third on some frequently interdicted convoy routes — is turned over to both militia and resistance commanders.
Perhaps the most significant weapon in the Kabul regime's arsenal have been bags of Soviet-provided money. The Soviets found before the 1989 withdrawal that a million dollars can temporarily buy off many more Afghans that a million dollars' worth of bombs can kill. High salaries contribute to die loyalty of many of Kabul's combat units. Hie Kabul regime appears to have used this weapon with great skill in 1989-91. Soviet sources have stressed that containers of printed Afghan banknotes axe airlifted in, but the supply of hard currency — vital for bribery and securing loyalty — is also vital.
By mid-1990, there were reports that die Soviets were cutting back on the most expensive elements of the aid program to Afghanistan:	hard	currency and oil.
Because of the military importance of the currency, it was also reported that Kabul had tried to fill the gap by printing additional Afghan currency, risking increased inflation, reportedly 100% annually on the open market in Kabul.
