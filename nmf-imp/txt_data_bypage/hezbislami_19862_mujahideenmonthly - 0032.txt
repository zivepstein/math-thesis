PRISONERS SHOT WITHOUT BEING QUESTIONED
Hundreds- of prisoners have been killed without being asked a single question in Kabul's notorious Pul-i-Charkhi jail and some are under unbearable torture for such a long time that staff are not able to interrogate many prisoners for up to three or four years.
According to information leaked from the Directorate for Prisoners to Mujahideen circles in Kabul many of the staff of Pul-i-Charkhi jail are psychotic -sadists who enjoy torturing human beings.
An informant said that many prisoners had been shot without being questioned by the jail's officers .* just to save them the trouble of interrogation.
The informant said that under a special program directed by Soviet advisors almost all jail staff throughout the country wete being encouraged to take drugs and become addicts. He said that because of the addiction, the jail's officers had no patience to listen to prisoners' answers and often just guided them to a nearby field and summarily executed them.
According to the infoimant the files on many prisoners have never been sent to’any court whicn exists outside the thick, high and stony wails of
PuVi-Charkhi jail.
Because of the large number of inmates in different jails, particularly in Pul-i-Charkhi, some prisoners have not been questioned after more than th/ee or four years of detention.
Many a times a prisoner has been held for several years under interrogation, and in spite of no evidence or guilt of any crime, is still detained.
There are now more than 85,000 political prisoners in different jails throughout the country and this number only includes those who are known by relatives to be alive.
There are hundreds of familites who enquire daily at the Directorate of Prisoners, part of the Ministries of Defence and Interior, about the whereabouts of relatives who have disappeared after im: prisonment.
