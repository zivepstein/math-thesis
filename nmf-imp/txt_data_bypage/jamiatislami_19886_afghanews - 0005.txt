before toe invasion and even after the invasion have shewn readiness to discuss toe problems with the Soviets? The answer is the false pride of a frustrated super power.
Tiie Soviets entered Afghanistan thinking it an easy victory, but that victory never came. The Red Army proved to be helpless in suppressing toe Resistance of Afghans which were equipped with the weapon of faith. Failure In the battlefield and international rejection of the invasion frustrated the Soviet Army and politicj&as. The bitter taste of defeat In Afghanistan has forced the Soviet leaders to continue making trouble for Afghans by continuing to interfere in the affairs o! Afghanistan.
The obvious victory of Afghans which was marked by the withdrawal Is an incomplete one. The people of Afghanistan waged jehad to force the invaders out of the country and determine their future.
This aim will be achieved when the puppet regime is destroyed and a real representative government ie Afghanistan is formed. As Prof. Rabbani, leader of jamiat has stated, the armed struggle for the liberation of Afghanistan and the establishment of an Islamic government will continue and the total victory of the Afghan people is inevitable.
unprofessional approach leads to disaster
SOME factions of tha Afghani Resistance have committed serious mistakes fcy exposing the intentions of the Mujahideen through the mass media.
In the past two weeks we have been witness to these mistakes commuted by individuals in the name of toe Alliance,
Seating with toe enemy is a serious business and deserves extreme care and observation of the rules of warfare,
No doubt the enemy moral has been lowered as the result of the Soviet troops withdrawal and that must be exploited. H is equally important to plan the operation in such a way to ensure quick and total victory. This is vital for further demoralization of toe enemy and to speed up toe fall of the regime.
On the contrary, if mistakes are committed It could lead to the strengthening of the enemy position.
The golden principle of warfare is hiding ones own intentions and discovering of these of the enemy', in the absence of the element of surprise casualties mount beyond an acceptable limit and could even lead to the failure of the operation.
The withdrawal of a lew thousand Soviet troops and evacuation of some garrisons should not lead the Mujahideen to a state of carelessness in which all toe rules of warfare are ignored.
The importance of publicity can not be ignored but not at the cost of revealing military secrets. It is much more * credible to speak to the press about major victories after they have been achieved,
LUTFURAHMAN. the head of the Association of Jami at pilots, said that the puppet regime is in possession of 337 fighter planes, SOS pilots and air crews.
He said that the duties of the air force include combat and logistics missions, and the evacuation of war victims.
He added that Mi-$ helicopters which were the main means of transportation have ceased to be as effective because it is defenseless against the improved anti-aircraft equipment of the Mujahideen. Nowadays fighter helicopters are being used for transportation.
Despite the assignment of the fighter helicopters to j resupply different bases the j enemy is facing great	j
logistical problems. For | example it was planned to j transport 700 tons of goods to E toe garrison in Barikoot. Only \ 100 tons of goods were	j
transported with the loss of j five helicopters, This	j
situation forced the enemy to j abandon the garrison in j Bar ik cot,	j
Lutfurrahman added that j after toe Mujahideen acquired j effective missiles about three j hundred Soviet DR A planes were shat down and S30 air crew were killed. The puppet regime has toe ability of training 30 pilots in one year which is only possible by spending enormous amount of money and losing of planes.
According to Lutfurahman, in 19S7. in each 30 hours the i regime and the Soviets lost	j
one plane and in each 10	j
hours an air crew died.
Sayyerf Mustafa another	j
pilot anti a member of the Association said that the	j
moral of the BRA air force is	j
very low and there are	j
constant arguments and	|
wrangling amongst them.	j
