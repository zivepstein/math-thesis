 and co-ordinate Mujahideen in the five provinces in the North They asked all the Parties in the resistance to take active part tn these efforts because that is’the only way to resist the enemy effectively
 Among those who spoke on the occasion were Prof B. Rabbani and Allauddin the commander of the Mujahideen of Herat
 The meeting was well organized and well participated. The revolutionary songs sung by the students of Madina Orphanage and other Jamiat schools give a special color to the meeting Delegations from some other political parties also took part in the meeting.
                                  AFGHANS DEMONSTATED IN DELHI
 The Afghan community whose number reaches 6,000. demonstrated in two places in Delhi to protest against the occupation of their country by the SovietsThe demonstration took place when Gorbachov was paying an offical visit to India indian police tried hard to stop such demonstrations and even put a large number of Afghans under house arrest.
 Police resorted to physical violence to stop the peaceful demonstration of Afghans as a result of which some Afghans were injured and a large number of them arrested It is a pity when a criminal like Gorbachov is welcomed with flower petals and the peaceful demonstration of Afghans who have been driven out of their country meet with violence from the Indian police Itexposes the nature of Rajivs democracy
                                       WHEN THE IRON MEN WEPT
 Everybody was happy because they had defeated the enemy and captured Ferkhar garrison It was indeed a moment for joy Mujahideen were busy transfering the prisoners and carrying away the ammunition and weapons that they had captured They were expecting a Soviet counter attack so they were prepared to defend themselves in that case Mujahideen had recieved strict directions from their Chief Commander to make sure that every thing was counted and recorded. After a victory is the time when some people are undiciplined and become careless, the Mujahideen were watching the situation to prevent that from happening
 Somebody complained that Safiullah, a group commander, had taken a coat for himself without reporting it to the appointed committee, Safiullah was one of those few who led the attack to capture the garrison Masood called Safiullah and scolded him in front of all the Mujahideen for what he had done He wept and ail the Mujahideen wept with him He was embarrassed for a mistake which is part of the life of ail humanbeings Masood wanted to teach every one the need for self- control when they are victorious
 Safiullah wept for his mistake but that was all he did This shows the degree of his loyalty to his leader and the depth of his commitment to the cause of Jehad After the incident he was given another job to suvery the disposion of the enemy forces for another attack in Nehrin district but unfortunately he was ambushed by the enemies of Islam and was martyred He did not find the chance to see the victory of Nehrin and show his abilities again and this time be careful not to commit a small mistake The mistake made him more dear to the Mujahideen and will cause him to be remembered more than usual
 PEACE BE UPON ALL THOSE OBEDIENT SERVANTS OF ALLAH WHO WHEN THEY ACHIEVE VICTORY DO NOT BECOME PROUD AND WHEN FAIL DO NOT LOSE HEART WHEN THEY COMMIT A MISTAKE BECAUSE OF THEIR WORLDY NATURE REPENT AND ASK THEIR LORD TO FORGIVE THEM THEY ARE TRUE MUSLIMS AND THE MOMORY OF HISTORY WILL KEEP THEIR GOOD NAMES
