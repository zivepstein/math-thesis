                                        THE SITUATION IN DARWAZ
                                                               a
 Darwaz is a district of Badakhshan province situated along the border with the Soviet Union. The people of Darwaz have been resisting the Soviet invaders and their puppets since 1979 This is a remote area with little connection with the outside world. The reporter of Afghan News talked to Abdul Karim a young Mu jahid from Darwaz who has recently come from the area. Here are some extracts from his conversation:
 It takes one month to come from Darwaz to Pakistan. The route is difficult and one has to climb more than eight passes each about 16,000 feet high. Darwaz is eight days walk from Faizabad the provincial capital of Badakhshan. There is no road passable by car fromFaizabad to Darwaz.
 The Mujahideen of Darwaz are organized in 4 base areas namely, Koof, Sheki. Shoryan and Mymay. The chief commander of Darwaz is Ameer Mohammad Fedaii. All the Mujahideen of Darwaz are members of Jamiat and no other party has a presence there.
 The Mu jahideen have a civilian organization besidse the military organization in the area. They have financial, military, cultural and judicial committees. The Chief Justice of Darwaz is Mawiawi Shair Ahmad. Shariat Law is applied in the area and Mujahideen collect taxes to meet their needs.
 The medical situation in the area is bad. There is no doctor . There are only two paramedics who have studied short term courses in Peshawar. The people are deprived of the merits of modern medicine.
 Mujahideen do not have any publication but they are running ten schools. The teachers are chosen from amongst the educated people and the religious scholars.
              WE THANK ALL THOSE 122 COUNTRIES WHO VOTED FOR THE UN RESOLUTION ASKING FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FOREIGN(SOVIET) TROOPS FROM AFGHANISTAN.
 The food situation is very serious. The area is very mountinous and does not have a lot of land which could be cultivated. The available land does not yeiid enough because of the absence of good seed and the lack of enough cattle. The Soviets burn the crops when they attack. People bring food from Ragh area which takes eight days for a two way journy . Last spring both Mujahideen and the local people were facing shortage of food In order to be able to buy food they need cash This is the only way to help the people and Mujahideen in this remote area.
 In one village last year, the Soviets killed 60 cows and 30 donkeys and a large number of sheep and goats.
 Militarily speaking, the Mujahideen in this area have logistic problemsShortage of weapons and ammunition are alway a problem.
 Darwaz is located on the border and the Amu river seperates the area from the Soviet Tajikistan province. The villages are so close that one can see a man standing in a Soviet village from an Afghan village. In all the military operations the Soviets bring
