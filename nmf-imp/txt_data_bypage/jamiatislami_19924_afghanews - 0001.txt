Kubul loses Mazar
The Kabul regime lost control of Mazar-i-Sharif, the second most important city of Afghanistan and the capital of Balkh Province, on March 18. Half of the city came und^ control of the Mujahideen while the remaining half is being ruled by the rebel militia forces erf Dostum and Kayan. -
The Mujahideen of Jami'at played the leading role in fighting that led to fall of Mazar. Jami'at leader has described this victory as the most important achievement of the Mujahideen since the start of Jehad.
Attack on the city preceded by operations launched in Balkh, Samangan and Jawzjan provinces. The Mujahideen liberated all districts of Balkh, a sub-district of Jawzjan and a district and part of the provincial capital of Samangan.
Exploiting the differences between Najib and its militiamen in the north, the Supervisory Council ordered launching of operations in Balkh and Samangan for the purpose of eliminating the rule the regime from the area.
Attack on Kholm District began on March 13. In three days of fighting, the Mujahideen liberated Kholm and brought under their control the road from Aibak to Mazar.
Simultaneously, the Mujahideen of Jami'at launched attacks, from two directions, on the enemy bases in Balkh Province. From south, the Mujahideen led by Commander Ata Mohammad cleared their way to the outskirts of Dehdadi air base after overrunning regime post on their way. From west, the Mujahideen under the command of Alam Khan reached the defenses of the Mazar city after liberating Faizabad, Daulatabad, Balkh and Nahr-i-Shahi districts . Charkent, southeast of the dty, also fell to the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen broke the defenses of the city and entered Mazar in the afternoon of March 18.
As the Mujahideen approached the city, the Kabul regime troops evacuated Mazar and retreated to Dehdadi air base which was controlled by the
Dostum militiamen. Half of die city came under control of the Mujahideen and the other half under Kayan and Dostum militiamen. Withdrawal of regime troops from Mazar took place at die time when Genual Nabi Azimi, the commander of Kabul garrison, was still in Mazar. He had gone there to mediate between the rebel militia forces and Najib.
Liberation Mazar was organized. The Mujahideen made every effort to protect the life and property of the people. There were no incident of looting and random bloodshed in the areas under control of the Mujahideen.
On March 21, the traditional flag-hoisting ceremony on the shrine of Hazrat Ali (the fourth Calif of Islam) took place in the presence of both the Mujahideen and militia forces.
Kabul continued to refute reports of Mazar's fall, but it refused to allow foreign journalists to visit the area.
In Samangan, the Mujahideen continued their advance towards Aibak after the fall of Kholm. They captured a battalion of KHAD and took the governor of Samangan as a prisoner. They stopped their further advance due to the presence of militiamen of Kayan because Mujahideen had no intention of provoking an aimed a clash with them.
The Mujahideen also liberated Qala-i-Zal District in Kunduz and brought Kunduz-Sirkhan Bander road under their control. Pressure on the city of Kunduz and the center of Baghlan is mounting.
The fall of Mazar and Samangan is
an extremely bad news for Najib who depended on the Kabul-Mazar road fra transportation of food and fuel. Prices of food and fuel has started to rise making it difficult for die ordinary people to buy their daily bread.
The situation in Balkh turned against die Kabul regime in mid January when Najib wanted to replace the commander of the border town erf Hayratan, General Momen, by a more loyal officer. The move was considered as an attempt by Kabul to curb the power to local militia groups. Kayan and Dostum militiamen assured defiant Momen of their support. Negotiations to resolve the dispute almost succeed at the end of February after Najib agreed U> transfer Juma Azek, an officer involved in the dispute. He, however made a mistake by asking the militiamen to abandon their opposition to the transfer of Momen from his post The agreement collapsed and Azek was sent back to Mazar. In the meantime militiamen who enjoy support of some ranking members of Watan Party, contacted different Mujahideen groups. It seemed that they were looking for a type of recognition from the Mujahideen in return fra common stand against the regime. The militiamen were working to bring Mazar and other areas, controlled by the forces loyal to Najib, under their rule. The Mujahideen parties, including the Supervisory Council, kept talking to the rebel militia groups without agree ing to their demands. The Mujahideen were, and still are, ready to provide protection fra militiamen if they sur rendered to them. Under these ciicum stances, the Supervisory Council, the most powerful organization of the Mujahideen in the area, decided to launch operations before the developments went in the wrong direction Militia forces remained neutral in fighting between the Mujahideen and the forces loyal to Najib.
The UN closed its regional office in Mazar and flew out its officials to Kabul.
