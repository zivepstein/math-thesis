         The newspapers have reported that the puppet regime and the Soviet Union have signed an agreement on a phased withdrawal of Soviet troops if an agreement is reached in Geneva. By this the Soviets are trying to give the impression that there is a free government in Kabul which could ask for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops. This is an attempt to prove that they came at the invitation of the Kabul regime/andrnow they will leave with their agreement.                             ,
         The whole world has rejected the idea of the invitation to invade and they know about the true nature of these types of agreements. A regime whose existence is guaranteed by the Soviet presence, a regime whose leader is replaced by the Soviets, a regime whose institutions are answerable to Soviet advisors can not have such agreements with the Soviets. Their relationship is the relationship of master and slave. All these games are to decieve world opinion about the realities of the situation in Afghanistan and thereAsome who quote these as real developments.
         If these so-called agreements are given weight, the Soviets can sign thousands of them with their puppetSv*S they have done in the past. We reject all such steps as propaganda games of the Soviets to decieve world opinion.

         The leader of Egyptian muslim brotherhood,' Umar Talmas any died at the age of 82 last month. He spent 19 years of his valuable life in Naser's jail and suffered in the defence of his belief. Talmasani as the leader of am Islamic movement took great interest in the cause of the Islamic world, specially the Afghan cause.
         He visited Pakistan and met with Mujahideen and Muhajureen (refugees) and exchanged ideas. His death is a loss to the Islamic movement and we pray for his soul and hope that his followers firmly follow his path, the path of revival of true Islamic order in all the muslim world.
