AFGHANISTAN
The popular armed resistance of Muslims in Afghanistan has not abated. The imperialist superpowers are still bent on intruding in Afghan Internal Affairs by supporting the Marxist regime in Kabul. The Ummah Islamiyah through its Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers must evolve pragmatic and operational plans of Action for meaningful settlement and for restructuring of Afghanistan and not rest content with only pious resolutions or by merely doling out some charities. The World Muslim Congress {Motamar} herein salutes all the unknown but brave 1.3 million men, women and children, who gave their lives in this fight for freedom and to liberate Afghanistan. Simultaneously we should not forget the over 5 million Afghan people who were forced to flee from their homeland and sought refuge especially in the neighboring countries of Pakistan and Iran. There is now fear of famine in Afghanistan.
The gravest issue, at present, is the formation of an accepted government in Kabul agreed by all the Mujahideen groups and the next biggest issue is that of the all-round reconstruction and rehabilitation in Afghanistan. The UN’s Secretary-General has also come forward with a plan for solving the Afghan problem. This has been carefully studied by the leaders of the Afghan Mujahideen and also by the OIC. The propect of such a plan working well is doubtful in view of the fact that outside forces are bent on imposing their aims and objectives on Afghans and none of the so-called peace-initiator is ready to give the generality of Afghan populace the unconditional rights of self determination and true independence. Care, before formal elections, have to be taken for the Transition period.

CRISIS IN OTHER PEACES
There are other crisis situations in other parts of Muslim world such as.
Iran, Turkey and a few other places, also need the most serious urgent attention of the world of Islam for an honorable and amicable settlement, to start with the Kurds of Iraq who have been assured democracy and autonomy. The history of the Kurds go back to the glorious days of Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi.
(c)	Cyprusissue: ThelslamicConference was urged of Foreign Ministers to set up a representative Commission, with the mandate to resolve the Cyprus issue, which is under fire for the last 15 years, on the basis of the repeated call of the Cyrprus Islamic Turkish peoples, in seeking the establishment of a bi-zonal, bi-communal Federal Republic in Cyprus.
The World Muslim Congress {the Motamar) appeals to all the leaders of the Muslim countries and the Muslim community to exert politically and economically. Muslims want peace in the land of Cyprus but on the basis of justice and equity.
(d)	The Filipino Muslim Struggle: We appeal to the ICFM to declare its unanimous support for the Bangsa Moro Islamic Nation’s right of self-determination. We appeal to the 20th session of ICFM to use its strong and weighty influency with the Philippines government to honour its commitments to the Muslim peoples of the Philippines interims of the Tripoli Agreement and similar other agreements with the MNLF.
(e)	Ethiopia: Ethiopia is a historical land. It is known to the Muslims from the lime of the Holy Prophet. It was under Haile Selassie that during whose era wild efforts were made to make it a Christian country. Conditions became worse under the cruel Haile Mariam Mengustu. Thanks be to Allah that he ran away to Zimbabwe to save his life. This Muslim population, is so far so badly neglected, but forms 74%. Believers in Islam in this part of the world are looking up to the Ummah Islamiyah in general and the OIC in particular to come to their rescue. They surely need help and assistance especially socio-economic and cultural.
(f)	Eritrea: Eritrea, historically a Muslim land, because of its Islamic identity became a victim of Western colonialism. It was forced to be federated (with self-autonomy clause) with Ethiopia so as to provide Ethiopia with sea ports. In 1962 and in violation of UN resolution, Ethiopia annexed Eritrea and made it its province. The world, the UN and majority of the Muslim countries also kept inexcusable silence on this delicate but important issue. From 1962 started the real armed freedom struggle of the Eritreans and by their heroic struggle, the Eritrean freedom-fighters have taken the control of their homeland from the Ethiopian occupation force. From the very beginning the world Muslim Congress {the Motamar) had been supporting the Eritrean in their just struggle. It was our world Muslim Congress {the Motamar) which sent the first Eritrean delegate to the UN in the early sixties. The OIC must take up the Eritrea issue and see that Eritrea becomes an independent sovereign Muslim country and a member-state of the OIC.
(a) Iraq:- The saddest of all such tragedies is the lamentable situation in Iraq to-day. Peace, equity and democracy are the greatest needs for Iraq. These require concerted approach by the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers.
(g)	Famine: Again this year there is all the likelihood that widespread menace of famine has started threatening Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Shad, Mali, Mauritania, etc. The world Muslim Congress {the Motamar) urges that the OIC must activate effective and meaningful action plan to avert this menace of famine.
(b) The long-hanging matter of the Kurds, specially in Iraq,
