Text of the speech delivered by Prof. Rahbani in OIG Foreign Ministers conference in Cairo
In the name of God.
I am pleased to express my deep appreciation and thanks on behalf of the Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan to the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIQ for granting the Afghanistan seat to the Mujahideen in its session of March 1989 in Riyadh. Mujahideen leaders request Your Excellencies to take practical measures to further strengthen that just decision.
I would like to express my gratitude to the government of Egypt for hosting this historic conference and for the hospitality it has extended to the AIG delegation.
Dear brothers! The current problems of our country began when the communists took power in Afghanistan in April 1978. They killed President Daud together with his family, even though he had nurtured the communists during his prime ministership and had given them a share in,power after his 1973 coup. They also mudered thousands of innocent people. Russians and their satellite states in Eastern Europe supported the communist regime.
The Muslim nation of Afghanistan, however, proclaimed a general uprising from the very beginning of the 1978 coup. The determined resistance of our courageous nation as well as the deep internal divisions among the communist leaders brought the regime to the verge of total collapse.
The Russians were eye-witnesses to the decay of their puppet regime. Hoping to save it, they invaded Afghanistan . More than 115,000 Red Army troops poured into our country in the days following the 27th December 1979 .
The invading troops made a bloodbath in our country. Our national dignity, prestige and Islamic identity were attacked, our national treasures and natural reources were looted and our nation was subjected to genocide.
More than one and a half million people were martyred. About half a million persons were disabled. More than 600,000 innocent children became orphans. About 700,000 women became widows. More than five million ppeple became refugees in neighbouring countries.
More than 100,000 educated people, youths, technorats and scholars became refugees in western countries. More than 80 percent' of the country was ruined or destroyed.
According to UN estimates, about 30 million mines were planted in Afghanistan . These are taking a heavy toll on the lives of our women, children and young men, and will continue to do so for many years to come. At the moment of defeat and withdrawal of the Red Army, Gorbachev had remarked that his mines would fight the Afghans for years.
Honourable Ministers of OIC! ^
Item number 2, paragraph number 6, of the OIC charter states that OIC has; the duty to support the just struggles of all Muslim people for national independence ; ancl human rights. There OIC convened an ;emergency meeting at the request of some
of its members in the Spring of 1980, right after the Russian invasion. That historic session strongly condemned the Russian invasion as being , against all international laws and norms. It also suspended Afghanistan's membership of the Conference. Furthermore, it requested all the member states not to recognise the regime set up by the occupying forces, to stop all aid to the regime, to give shelter to the refugees, and to extend all necessary assistance to the Afghan people who had raised the banner of revolt and resistance against the invading forces.
The resolution of May 22, 1980 when 39 members met in Islamabad called on the Russians to leave Afghanistan immediately and unconditionally. Thus, in various sessions of the OIC, our just cause and our resistance were fully supported.
Finally, in the historic Riyadh session, the Afghanistan seat was given to the Mujahideen and four Muslim countries recognized the Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan. The Afghan people were hoping that other Muslim countries would also follow suit. Unfortunately this did not happen.
Respected brothers! The strong faith, the determination, the fortitude and die steadfastness of your heroic Afghan brothers and the continued support of the Muslim countries and of the international community finally resulted in the defeat and withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan. Russians also admitted that their agression was an inhuman act breaching international norms and laws. This confession was made in October 1989 by Foreign Minster Edvard Shevardnadze in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
Unfortuntely, his were empty words. Though Red Army troops left Afghanistan, yet the Russian advisers who design and implement war plans stayed. Their numbers even increased. The air lift which was started between Moscow and Kabul in the first days of the invasion, was re-started, right after completion of the troop withdrawal. More , sophisticated and deadly weapons, such as Scud and Oregan-which were not used in Afghanistan even when the Russians were there-were brought in in large numbers. This process still continues. Statistics of war casualties, gathered by independent observers, show that killing and destruction have increased in recent months. Thus, Russian military aggression has not ended. The communist Russian agents, who are largely responsible for the tragedy, did not leave with die Red Army. They still receive enormous amounts of military and financial aid from the Soviet Union. The Afghan tragedy continues despite ■ the formal withrawal of Russian troops.
The propaganda by the international media against our nation since the Red Army withdrew has added insult to injury. Unfortunately, die mass media in some Muslim countries have also been influenced by the Western media and repeat what they say. They call the Mujahideen extremists and war mongers. They call our struggle for liberation, independence, territorial integrri-ty and national sovereignty a civil war.
The fact is that we want peace and se-‘curity more than anyone else. We have been forced, however, to defend ourselves. Has the rain of Scud and other Rusian rockets on our villages and towns ended? Has the air lift between Moscow and Kabul, which transports in enormous .quantities of destructives weapons, been cut off? Has the Russian interference in our domestic affairs ended? .Have the bloodbaths which were
filled by the Russian military invasion drained out?
It is the unaninous decision of our nation not to allow the puppet regime and the professional murderers of the communist PDPA to play a role in determining our future destiny. They are criminals and traitors who must face trial by the nation. Changing the name of the party is insignificant and futile. Whatever mask they put on they are the same war criminals and cannot escape accountability to the nation.
While deeply appreciating the unfailing support of die OIC, the Afghan delegation would like to propose the following:
•The Russians should be condemned once again for their crimes against our nation during their military occupation. Their continued interfeence and aggression should also be strognly condemned. The Proclamation of perestroika in Russia does not absolve the Russians from their past war crimes or continued interference in Afghanistan.
•Russian leaders should be asked to stop their aid to the war mongering regime in Kabul.
•Najib's regime should be declared illegal and illegitimate.
• The Mujahideen government (AIG) should be recognized In principle.
•Mujahideen should be helped to overthrow the puppet regime as soon as possible and restore peace and seucity to their country.
“Assistance to the refugees should continue as before so that their lives are not endangered.
•The program for repatriation of refugees is premature and should be stopped. Conditions are not suitable for refugees to return to their homland. The factors which caused migration at the beginning are still there. Additional factors such as mines, hunger, and diseases also severely threaten the lives of our people.
•Mujahideen should be given the opportunity to form their new government through a shura of "Ahl-i Hal wa Aqd"-which is traditionally called "Loya Jirga"-so that doubts about the representative nature of their government be removed.
•The Afghan nation should be suport-ed to restore its Islamic identity, national unity, independence and territorial integrity.
•The Jihad of our heroic naion deserves commendation.
•All the countries and relief organizations should be requested to share the burden of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
•OIC in co-operation with the Islamic Development Bank should cooperate in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. A joint commission needs to be formed.
•The Afghanistan seat at the Islamic Development Bank shouldbe given to the Mujahideen.
•The Soviet Union shoud be reqested to pay war reparations and to unwrite the cost of the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
•A permanent commission be formed to help the Afghan people to achieve com plete liberation and to reconstruct Afghanistan.
Dear brothers! This conference is held at a decisive moment of history. At present, our world is witnessing major historic . changes and which no one expected before. The collapse of Communism and the communist regimes in Eastern Europe, the removal of tile Berlin Wall, the unification of the two Germanies, the end of the cold war are all important in our time. These changes herald hope and good news to others. For the Muslims, however, they bring the mes-
