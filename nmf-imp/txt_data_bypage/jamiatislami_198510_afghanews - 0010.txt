                             THE__ROLE ' OF Tiffi_¥OMEN_IN_THE_ JEHAD
         Our .-war against the Soviet invaders is a war against aggression «. This type of war, which is fought for a just cause, , is called"Jehad". Jehad is a duty of every male and female in a muslin community. Like any other form of worship it falls on the. shoulders of the individual and of society.
         The history of Islam tells the story of women who have fought with arms or have, helped the fighters by providing food arid medical eare.. The wife of the prophet (peace be upon him) was one of these,
         Xn our war against the Soviet invaders, Afghan women play an active role. In Afghanistan, because of the presence of a large number of men usually more than the number of guns we have, there is no need: for women to be involved in battle activities. But Afghan women, contrary to what is commonly believed, are not sitting and doing nothing to support the Jehad, They are helping their sons, brothers and husbands, in preparing food and. taking care of wounded Mujahideen. Their encouragements boost the morale of the fighters. Some brave Afghan women have even taken part in armed combat.
         If the oursida, world does not see evidence of women's participation in the Jehad it is because of cultural and religous considerations.
         Our women help the Jehad in our own way and their support is is vital for "its continuation. It is not possible for a man to fight if he lacks the support of his wife, mother or sisters. The percentage of women sympathetic to the cause of the Jehad is higher than non-combatant men. This is because the womenfolk are more vulnerable to Soviet atrocities than men.                                 ■
         Staying within the limits of our culture and religious beliefs, the Afghan resistance enjoys the full support of the Afghan women. Demonstrations and other activities by our sisters against the Soviet invaders is proof of this.

      Intelligence reports reaching Mujahideen say that the Soviets are planning a large offensive against the Mujahideen in and around the Panj-shir. This offensive may cover the areas' of Andarab, Kh.ost, Kohistan and Salng. It seems that the attack against the neighbouring areas will be carried out with the purpose of isolating the Panjshir. Mujahideen expect the attack at any moment.
      Some forces have already started entering the valley under the guise of resupplying existing bases. Mujahideen have recently destroyed six tanks and six trucks;- and killed 44 soldiers of the new forces.
