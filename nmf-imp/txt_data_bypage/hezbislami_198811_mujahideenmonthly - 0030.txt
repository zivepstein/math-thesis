Cont. from 26 older comrades', i.e., from the officers, that nearly 80 percent of the country was under the control of this handful' of dushman, and that the 'local' Soviet power is only to be found in the cities and what’s more not in all of them. This is not bad for a handful'. A turban, or simply a skull cap, tired faces, hardened hands from heavy work from early childhood, a very long shirt, large baggy trousers, sandals on bare feet in winter and summer alike, a shawl, used as blanket or pillow and for protection against cold or heat, at home masses of children, a wife, and elderly parents-these are the 'stooges'.

I saw their weapons and could only shrug my shoulders. AK's, AKM's, TT's, Makarvo’s, Dashaka's, Goriunov's. I will not argue, there were also weapons made in the west. For instance, some British rifles, from the beginning of the century, or parabellums’, prototypes of which were rotting under Stalingrad, or ‘Mausers', the type used by Dato Tutashia when he was running around in the mountains ...

But when I asked them if they knew what an M-16 was they shrugged their shoulders and inquired what was it and how did one eat it. Of course, they do have automatic rifles - for every 1,500 Soviet rifles they will have two or three, but no M-16‘s.
This also does not add up. Ahal You are thinking about Stingers. They do not give you any peace. But allow me to ask how many of these stingers there are? Not so many, and the few there are appeared only a year ago.

And another thing: reconciliation. Pray, what kind of reconciliation? Afghanistan is occupied. It Is occupid by the 'valiant' Soviet army. With whom would you have them reconciled - with the occupant?
Reconciliation - a cloudy, misty, and incomprehensible concept. But the fact that the Soviet airforce 'reconciles' itslef to bombing, basically peaceful and defenceless villages is as true and clear as daylight.
And now allow me to give my opinion on these questions If you are really aiming for

peace, democracy, openness and so on, you would pull the Soviet army out of Afghaistan and allow real openness about this country; you would publish the data on the victims, about how many mothers have lost their sons, and you would also tell about people like me, defectors. Some people would condemn us, but others may give it some thought and ask why' did they defect
But you will not do this. Because of your communist nature, you are afraid of everything, of heat and cold, of strong contrasts, and particularly freedom and independent thinking. Your colour is grey. Only the frame is red. And being grey yourself, you want the
