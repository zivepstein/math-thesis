THE THRONE OF JUSTICE
"Whal is my crime?" this little boy seems to be saying to the world oppressive system that's still
protecting Kabul regime
The present contradictory world tensions are uniformly sending out their messages of hope to billions of men suffering today in silence. It is indeed a sign of relief at last, to know that the usurped global seat of leadership is to be evacuated for good, and the battered throne of justice is to be restored back to rule. The world will surely be at peace if oppression could finally be put at bay and mankind stands the chance of a natural brotherhood if sanity is unconditionally released from jail. Despotism and totalitarianism are only advanced form of tyranny but injustice as a crime presents a broad spectrum of vices.
The decade old Afghan revolution will serve well here as a reference, and its numerous achievements since inception have uncovered to us the conflicting nature of man-made ideologies. A major objective of the struggle is to retrieve back the denied right of self-determination. Even the general call for a representative Islamic government is only a plausible reality of this basic fundamental. There is nothing un-natural for a community in choosing the type of life they want to live in as much as that is an outcome of a popular consensus. For the Afghans to demand the right of sovereignty is not a new phenomenon in human historical developments. The real question lies in why others outside the radius of the community want to impose an unwanted regime on them?
In this world of time and space, man is bound by laws outside his stretch. It is the divine-given right on earth that accords every one the liberty of choice. Each person is free to fashion his life and tastes as much as nature will permit him to do so, provided the collective survival of his society or a part there-of is not endangered in such a process.
