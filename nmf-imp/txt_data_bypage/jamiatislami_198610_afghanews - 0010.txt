 This is a tragic but a true story. One day In 1984 a Soviet, convoy was ambushed by Mujahideen near Chardara district of Kunduz provlce. A gpviet officer was killed. The Soviets attacked the area. They killed 400 people, mostly innocent civilian population. The rest of the population felt scared and left the area. They moved to the mountanous regions and stayed there the winter and continued their sad journey the next spring.
 Several of these people especially the very young and very old ones died along the way because of severe weather and sickness.As we walk^cf we saw new graves along the track. These graves belonged to the 111-fed and sick refugees who could not survive the hardship of a long trip and died before reaching the safety.
 i asked myself "why should these people suffer and for how long?" Tears came to my eyes and started to weap.
 Minutes later I thought this is life and these things happen. We are not the first people who has suffered and may not be the last. Suffering a way of defense of faith and freedom is a type of worship. What will happen if we stop resisting.the enemy who humilate our religion and try to destroy our culture. If we do not resist we become like the people of Bukhara< The muslim occupied areas in central Asia) who are not their own masters. What happened to their culture, their beautiful mosques and their freedom, it js better to suffer than to submit to invaders.          ,
 A verse from the Holy Ouran relieves us when we go under suffereing or
 pain:
 SO LOSE NOT HEART NOR FALL INTO DESPAIR:
 FOR YOU MUST GAIN MASTERY IF YOU ARE TRUE IN FAITH
