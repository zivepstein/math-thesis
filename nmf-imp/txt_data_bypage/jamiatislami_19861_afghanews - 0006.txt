                       BASELESS OPTIMISM        • •
                                 t
    After the summit talks between the super powers and the proximity talks in Geneva one could see Increased optimism among the media about a political settlement for the Afghan issue. .
    This optimism was based on the way that the Soviets expressed their view about Afghanistan in the summit talks and the change of tone in the Soviet official media. LittllT attention was paid to what they were saying. Soviet leaders who know the desire of the world for peace started to play on this noble wish, to minimize political pressure on them. The Soviets were soft towards America and did not accuse her of having hundreds of training bases along the borders of Afghanistan. Ho softness was shown towards the Afghan people .                 •
    On the military side war is continuing on an even higher level than in previous years. ;
    The Soviets insistence on direct talks between the puppet regime and Pakistan is part of their plan to get recognition of the puppet regime and give nothing in return.
    The offer of diroct talks is an attempt'to put pressure on the Pakistan government to change its position. It is a political offensive to relieve the Soviets from the pressure of defeat in the U.N and the consequences of the U.N Human Rights commission's report on violation of Hunan Rights in Afghanistan.
     Therefore the change is superficial and is part of a political game not a real attempt to solve the problem,
