                               ANOTHER BONUS FOR THE COMMUNISTS
 ICRC has decided to open a hospital in Kabul to treat the puppet troups After securing the release of a dozen Soviet POWs in a one-sided deal this is a second humanitarian)!) step that ICRC have taken for the benefit of the Soviets and their puppets
 ICRC authorities are trying to give the impression that they have taken another positive step in their humanitarian field, While the treatment of wounded people from any side of the conflict is not something objectionable the way ICRC is doing it is questionable
 In the previous deal, some Soviet criminals were sent back to the Soviet Union but Mujahideen received nothing in return,A few months ago Mujahideen allowed them to meet some communist prisoners in Paktia province in return for nothing
 Now they have opened medical facilities for the puppets in Kabul without saying anything to the- Mujahideen in advance. The question is why this humanitrian organisation has limited its activities to Pakistan and occupied Kabul and do not do anything in the liberated areas of Afghanistan This way of dealing with the two sides of the conflict is biased towards the invaders and their puppets.
 The Soviets and their puppets have given permission for the ICRC to have medical activities in Kabul for political reasons and ICRC will be controlled strictly by the communists The argument made by ICRC that they treat non-communist as well goes againstthe reality of the situation in occupied Afghanistan. They have to do what the communists tell them
 The Afghan Resistance must speak from a responsible position and should say no to any one-sided deal The Resistance so far has done enough to show its good will and respect for humanitarian values The time has come for the Resistance to take into account the political implications of such deals. This is possible when decisions by the individual parties are stopped and the Alliance decides about the deals after a thorough study of the case
