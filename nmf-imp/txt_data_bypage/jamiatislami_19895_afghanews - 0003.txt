Increasing crime rate within Soviet Union
An aid-worker has con-irmed the Mujahideen's reports that the Salang highway has been blocked for enemy military convoys but that food is allowed to reach the population in Kabul.
Abdullah, who accompanied a team which distributed aid among the victims of the Salang atrocity, returned to Peshawar after several weeks in the Salangand Panjshir valleys.
He said the 8 kilometer section of road between Qalatak and Olang (in South Salang) was in control of the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen had set up check posts and were searching buses and trucks carrying passengers and food to the south.
Abdullah told Afghanews that when he was in Salang the communist >ombarded the valley day and night from air and with artillery and rockets.
He said that the Mujahideen in Salang who are assisted by a small group of the Mujahideen from Panjshir had scored many victories. They had captured large quantities of arms and ammunition, he added.
Abdullah and his team distributed relief goods among the Salangi families who left their villages after the Soviets destroyed their houses and killed about 800 civilians on January 23.
The villages on the two sides of the road from Tajikan to Olang were totally destroyed and some of the victims of the atrocity were still buried in the rubble of their houses, he said.
The team distributed aid among 1700 families who live in Jabul Seraj as refugees.'
Abdullah said that the price of food commodities in Shemali and Panjshir changed due to the road situation. If the Salang road was open the prices were relatively low and in the case of its closure the prices went up.
He gave the following figures for the prices of essential commodities in Gulbahar, a town at the mouth of the Panjshir valley:
Wheat 650 Afs/7 kilograms, rice 1400 Afs/7 kilograms, sugar 1000 Afs/ 7 kilograms, table salt 500

Figures released at a press-conference for Soviet journalists by the Ministry of Internal Affairs show a rapidly increasing crime rate within the Soviet Union.
Since these are first official figures to be issued since 1933, when they were banned by Stalin, it is impossible to say how the increase compares with previous years, but over the past year alone the increases in violent crime are alarming enough, and certainly give the lie to the generally held view of the Soviet Union as a peaceful and well-ordered society. Izvestiya (14 February, evening edition) published a table of the figures.
ment seems a bright spot. But Izvestiya (8 February, evening edition) ascribed the drop more to the passivity of law enforcement officials than to an actual decrease in the numbers of such crimes. Specialists considered that only two percent of the cases of bribe-taking ever came to light
One aspect of the rise in crime discussed at the meeting which worried Izvestiya was that 11 per cent of all crimes had been committed by juveniles. An even more disturbing figure was that 88,000 crimes were committed by juveniles in groups, a quarter of them under the influence of alcohol.

By way of comparison, the figure for murder, though some way short of the comparable US figure, is far higher per head of the population than in most European countries.
The drop in fraud and embezzle-
Other figures given in the Izvestiya article testify to considerable unrest in corrective labour camps and alcohol correction centres.
