Sayyed Mahyuddin Sayyad
Wakil Sayyed Mohayuddin Sayyad, Jami'at commander in Teshkan valley of Keshm district, was assassinated by unknown men in Taliqan on April 8.
He had come to Taliqan to attend the 6th meeting of Supervisory Council. He was killed while praying in a mosque.
There is no information about the assassins but inquiry to track down the culprit (or culprits) has begun by the Council's concerned organizations.
The Kabul regime was quick in giving the report of the incidents, blaming the incident on one of the local Jami'at commanders. Jami'at does not role out KHAD's involvement in the assassination to create tension between Mujahideen causing a delay in the expected military operations.
Sayyed Mahyuddin Sayyad led more than 1500 armed Mujahideen in Teshkan side-valley. He is known as Wakil Sahib because he was a member of parliament during the time of the king.
He took part in many battles against the the communists and the Red Army. He was one of the admirers of Commander Ahmad Shah Masood.
He survived an attempt on his life in 1985 but one of his hands was paralyzed due to the injury he sustained in the incident.
Sayyed Mahyuddin was bom 56 years ago in the village of Marghzar of Teshkan, a narrow valley parallel to the main Keshm valley. His father, Sayyed Shir Khan was a rich man.
Wakil Mahyuddin fmished primary school in Teshkan and learned about Islam from Maulawi Saray in Keshm.
He has established nine Madrasas or "religious schools" and 14 schools including one girls’ school. He runs a good hospital.
