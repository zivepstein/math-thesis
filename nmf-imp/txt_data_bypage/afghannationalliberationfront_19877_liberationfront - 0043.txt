Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged : and Allah is indeed able to give them victory:
Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: our lord is Allah — for had it not been for Allah's repelling some men by means of others, cloisters and churches and oratories, and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is often mentioned, would assuredly have
been pulled down. Verily Allah help one who help him. Lo! Adah is Strong, Almighty.
