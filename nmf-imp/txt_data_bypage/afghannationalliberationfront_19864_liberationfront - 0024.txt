 ENLIGHTENMENT.
     The Russians, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are invited by their puppet Babrak or they have come on their own initiative, must evacuate Afghanistan.
     Power is not my objective, my sole aim and objective is to liberate Afghanistan, serve the nation not as their leader or head of the state but, as an ordinary citizen of Afghanistan.
     My Afghan brothers ! Elect your leader, and form your Government in exile, before you return to Afghanistan so that the tug of war for power would be prevented.
     Whatever, we do and struggle for, is to liberate Afghanistan with the wishes of the Afghan Mujahid nation, and whatever, we expect from our friends and freedom loving nations is, to support us without preterms and conditions.
