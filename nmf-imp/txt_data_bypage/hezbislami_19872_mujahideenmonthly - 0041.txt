“We believe that the continuation of our armed struggle will ultimately force the aggressive Russians to vacate our country unconditionally. We believe in the definite victory of the Jehad of our Muslim nation and have no doubts about it. The situation of Jehad has been, after eight years and
eight months, better than any year before”.
