                                        STATE SPONSORED TERRORISM
 The Soviet Union is one of the countries which have used terrorism for its political aims.
 It has trained and equipped terrorists directly or indirectly. Soviet terrorist activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan is obvious . Every body knows that the real leaders in Kabul are the Soviets, so they are responsible for every thing which is done by their puppet. In the past terrorists hijacked a Pakistani plane to Kabul and killed an innocent person. The terrorists were given better weapons and other assistance.
 The world reaction was against a puppet regime which has no power not against * the real criminals, the Soviets. Then they started kidnapping some foreigner's from Pakistan and after several months of keeping them, released them.
 The countries concerned thanked the puppet regime (while the Soviets deserved condemnation ). Now they are sending bombs against civilian targets in Pakistan. The main targets are "Pakistani civilians and defenceless refugees.
 On July 13th , a land mine planted by the Soviet agents killed ten and injured 9 Afghan Refugees in Kuram Agency. These types of incidents are repeated every day.
                   We do not know why the world is not quick in condemnation of Soviet policies.
 Is it not a big crime to bomb the villages and towns of Afghanistan and force the population to leave the country and then kill them in their refugee camps? We are surprised by the world lack of attention. Soviets terrorism has no boundary. Soviets are the real criminals behind any terrorist action in this area because they are the real masters in the occupied parts of Afghanistan.
                                      DIVISION IN THE PUPPET RANKS
 Division among the puppets is a chronic disease which is incurable. Several attempts of the Soviets in the past to bring the factions together divided them more.
 The recent step of replacing Babrak by Najib is one of those attempts. Now Najib has started to purge his opponents in the party and government which leads to more division. It is a custom in Communist regimes that they do not criticise the leaders in power. When they are out of power then accusations and purges of their followers start.
 Najib, the new leader of the puppet party has dismissed some people and reinstalled some others and is criticising the way some people in the government and party work. This is not new. When the Communists made the coup they accused Daud of being the last remnant of the royal family, a dictator
