  rice , lea .clothes etc from the markets in the North to the mountainous part of Badakhshan In the evening we reached the first village in Worsaj
  To meet commander Masood and his men I had to go to the lower part of Worsaj a sub-District of Ferkhar district of Takhar province Worsaj is a beautiful valley with clean water and high mountains Worsaj is famous for its fruit The beauty of Worsaj had attracted the ex-rulers of Afghanistan and they payed visit there to hunt deer These visits did not help the people and they were deprived of the basic needs of life There was no hospital, no electricity and there was a bad dirty road The only people who made a profit of the presence of his Majesty was the local landlords who were controlling all the means of life of the people in the valley
  But all that was now part of the history In a garden prepared for the ex-king the , Mujahideen were roaming around
  The market of Worsaj had most of the necessary1 goods but at very high prices. This market provides the needs of the upper part of Panjshir and some parts of Badakhshan
  It should be mentioned that the enemy has never entered Worsaj so far but it is.getting its share of bombs frequently This valley is now a stronghold of the Mujahideen In Worsaj I came across two howitzers-captured from Naiirin and Ferkhar and an APC (in working condition) captured in Taliqan There are several Mujahideen-run schools in this valley
  A Jamial truck took me to Ferkhar city where I was supposed to meet the commander A short distance of about 30 km took about 4 hours of driving because of poor conditions of the road.
  Terknar, a beautiful valley starts from the lower part of Worsaj The land here is very
  fertile,
  At noon we reached the city. This was the first time I had been there The city was clear and was full of customers and all sorts of goods including soft drinks from Holland and Sweets from W Germany were available,
  Ferkhar was liberated in 1979 In 19$5 an enemy Garrison was established in the lower part of the valley Attacks by the local Mujahideen could> not force the enemy to evacuate When Ferkhar was re-organized in a dramatic attack Mujahideen captured the enemy's Garrison, the first in its type after the Soviet invasion The enemy attempts to re-establish its Garrison failed
  The people of the valley are totally supportive to the Mujahideen
  The commander of Ferkhar is Sayved Yahya a young lieutenant graduated from the Military7 Academy of jarniat with a good reputation of piety, courage and understanding of the war Ferkhar now is organized on new lines and has been turned into a base of the Mujahideen Here 1 met some of my friends among the Mujahideen including Commander Masood As usual I found him friendly I was very happy to see that he is relaxed and found him more mature than io the past He had a long meeting with one of the Hezb commanders and reached an agreement on solving some local issues
  The next day we celebrated Eid We visited the mosque of the town Several speakers talked about Jehad the need for unity 1 witnessed how much the people were enjoying the presence of Masood in the mosque; they tried io shake his hand after prayers
  Mv trip to this part of the country was a unique experience which I enjoyed very much. I wish I were living permanently among the Mujahideen in the liberated areas
  of Afghanistan,
