            A FORTNIGHTLY BULLETIN OF JAM FAT I3LAMI AFGHANISTAN POST OFFICE BOX 264, PESHAWAR-PAKISTAN,
                   VOL. IV, NO. 3, 1/2/1988.
                                            UN OBSERVER fN KHOST
    It was reported by the mass media that prof. Flex Ermacora was flown by the puppet regime to Khost after the siege had been broken, It is said that Ermacora was depressed by the heavy damage to the buildings and streets from attacks by the Mujahideen.
    Mr Ermacora has done a good job by filing human rights abuses committed by the puppets and Soviet invaders in Afghanistan: Last year, the Soviets tried to use his trip to Kabul as a propaganda tool Mr Ermacora mentioned in his report an. improvement in the human rights situation in occupied Afghanistan This was not accurate and not based on free and fair investigation He was given a guided tour and talked to the selected people chosen by the puppet regime
 i Using the clause of improvement in the human rights situation the Soviets tried to
 I1 tell the world about the success of their policy of National Reconciliation. At that time
    Ermacora asked to go to Khost but was refused, After the long offensive in Khost he was taken there to he a witness of the destruction of buildings for which the Mujahideen
    are blamed.
    This is an unpleasant development Our enemy which is a superpower can arrange such tours when it suits it and blame the Reslstance for all the destruction, This means using the UN as a propaganda, tool for specific reasons
    Dr. Ermacora on the other hand does not have that type of access to the areas which the other side of the'conflict (Mujahideen) control to measure the scale of destruction ■ ’ suffering of the population and disruption of the way of life. The only way for him is to meet some refugees io Pakistan. Under these circumstances can he expect to come up with a report which is fcalah ced? The answer i? negative
    We hope that such a respectable person as prof Ermacora and such a prestigious organisation as the UN should not be allowed to be used for the propaganda purposes of
    an aggressor power which has violated a UN charter in invading an independent country and has ignored the repeated call by the UN to end its occupation of Afghanistan
                          EXPLOSION IN JALALABAD THE WORK OF THE REGIME
    The puppet regime in Kabul exploded two bombs in Jalalabad city during Ghafar Khan's funeral ceremony and blamed the Mujahideen for the explosions.
    Ghafar Khan the famed leader of Pushtoons. died in Peshawar and two days later was taken to Jalalabad (Afghanistan i to be buried there. Knowing this, the Islamic Unity of Afghan Mujahideen announced a ceasefire along Toorkham-Jalalabad road and around I the area he was supposed to be buried
 | The procession of hundred cars arrived in Jalalabad safely. Ten minutes after the j burial two explosions took place in the car park close to the graveyard. Fourteen people ; died including 9 Pakistanis who had accompanied the funeral and others were injured, t
 / The regime immediately started to accuse the Mujahideen for the explosion and started 1— ----------------------— ____________________________________________________
