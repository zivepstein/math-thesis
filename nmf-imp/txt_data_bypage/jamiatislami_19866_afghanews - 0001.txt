    Mujahideerr are- those who are primarily concerned,...about these.tallies; Their concern ig-undexs'taadable -becauce..±alks.-are going on .about‘.Afghanis tan but the people of Afghanistan have not been asked to take prat in them, Mujahideen have repeated their positions on a number of occasions. They will• not—accept-'-the outcome of any talks which they..do not talcs part in. ICugahideen think, that--there--are only two sides in the conflict in Afghanistan, the Soviets who-have invaded our.country and, the Mujahideen who defend it against tile invaders.
    An 'American official who was asked by the members of the congress about a ooscible sell out of the Afghan cause rejected the idea but gave unreasonable explanations. He said that Mujahideen are not part of the negotiation because in 1902 when the talks began the Mujahideen were not united, flow that, they have formed a coalition they are being kept informed. In 1902 the Mujahideen were not asked to take part so they were not given the chance to send a delegation. Ibw that they are united they do not have any role to play except to wait for the news to reach them,. The question is not one of information. How can someone solve the problem 6f Afghanistan while the people of Afghanistan do not have any opportunity to talk about ,the future of their country. How can some countries provide guarantees for the implementation of the agreement in which, the people of that country do not participate.
    More than that we witness a contradiction in the policy of those who support the Geneva talks and at the same time, vote for annual U.N’s' resolutions. In the Geneva talks there is no talk about the ri glit of the oeople of Afghanistan for self-determination and the restoration of the non-aligned status of Afghanistan.
