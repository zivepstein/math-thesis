 la an occuppied country a few people caa be found who offer their services to the enemy and spy against their own people. In Afghanistan we also have these people who sell their honor and dignity to the enemies of the their religion.
 One such traitor was Qazi Sekander from Andarab in Baghlan province. He was captured by our valiant Mujahideen in Andarab and was submitted to the Judicial authorities to be tried. He was the person who led a delegation to Kabul to meet the puppet Babrak. He had appeared on enemy television and supported the occuption of Afghanistan. He had offered a home-made dock (Chapan) to Babrak, (the greatest traitor), a symbolic gesture to honor him.
 He has now been captured and is facing trail. Every body knows the panelty for such actions and he and other traitors will not escape un-punished.
