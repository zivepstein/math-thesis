 THE _TRUE _ SIDE_ OF^THE __ ST ORY
    The monthly bulletin of the Afghan Information Center,N* .5^- Has published an interview with the respected French Scholar Olivier Roy about the situation,in the Panjshir valley, In this interview there are two points which are not understood and need to be clarified.
 It is said that the proposal for a ceasefire was catagoricallly rejected by the Couneil of the Commanders. The fact is that there was not any discussion about a proposed ceasefire and there was no such proposal.
    It is also mentioned in the interview that the 200 prisoners of Pu'shghour were killed by Mujahideen before the Commando attack by. the Soviets. The true story is that they were killed by the Soviets bombardment and crossfiring between Mujahideen and the invading enemy. Mujahideen even evacuated and treated some of the injured prisoners.
                    T^_FIRST_PMSO^R_EXCHANGE
    Informed sources report that one Soviet soldier who was 'a prisoner in the hands of Mujahideen was exchanged with six Mujahideen who had been captured by Soviet-BRA forces. The deal took place in the first week of September between Ettihadi Island, for the Liberation of Afghanistan (prof. Sayyaf’s Organization) and the enemy side in Logar province.
    As far as we know, this is the first time which Soviets have, dealt with Mujahideen in-a prisoner exchange. In the past Soviets have been sensitive towards these types of dealings.
    It seems that the soldier belonged to a family which has a greai amount of influence inside the Soviet government.
