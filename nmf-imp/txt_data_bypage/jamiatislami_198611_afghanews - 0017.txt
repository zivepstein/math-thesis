 Dear brother flssalamu Alallcum wa Rahmatullah.
 First of oil I wish you good health and success in serulng the cause of Islam and Muslims.
 The siege of Herat city by-the enemy is continuing and Souiet air and ground forces ore Involved In the attacks along with the puppets.
 The Muslim Mujahideen ore resisting hertocally. Uie ore attacking the enemy position in the different villages around the city. Enemy easualties are high. Many puppet soldiers ore joining the Mujahideen each day.
 On 18/9/1986, fourteen puppet soldiers joined the Mujahideen, life are not worried obout the war with the Soviets and their puppets, what worries us is the lack of ammunition and food. Ule ore buying each RK-47 cartridge for 10 Rfgs. Our food supplies have all been burnt by the enemy and we buy medicine on the black market. The wounded Mujahideen ore suffering from lack of medicine. Most of the houses in the area hove been destroyed either by the enemy airforce or long-range artillery. Our Mujahideen need shoes, sleeping bags and warm clothes. Despite all this the Mujahideen ore continuing their struggle with high morale.
 The enemy morale seems low and they appear tired. Ule are fighting the enemy from house to house and from street to street. If we have the resources we are determined to force the enemy out of the area. The sad news is the martyrdom of Rbdul Hamid Khan the commander of Rhmadi front and his two companions. May they rest in peace.
 I hope that our message will be conveyed to the responsible people In Jomiat and the rest of those who are concerned to know about the heroic struggle of our Mujahideen and their problems.
                               Vours
