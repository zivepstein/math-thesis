WORLD WIDE SUPPORT FOR AFGHAN MUJAHIDEEN WOULD NOT ALLOW KABUL REGIME TO SURVIVE
    Peter Tonisen
    In his interview with Riath Daily published in Saudi Arabia, Peter Tomsen special envoy of United States for Afghan Mujahideen, has said.
    "United States always support the resistance movement of Afghan Mujahideen in their efforts for the establishment of a government in Afghanistan."
    In reply to a question, Peter Tomsen said that in spite of Soviets’ troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, Soviets still provide Kabul regime with modern sophisticated
weapons.
    He added that the world-wide support to Afghan Mujahideen would not allow Najeeb’s regime to survive, although he receives continuous support from Soviets.
    Mr. Tomsen, the U.S. special envoy to Mujahideen, added that Mujahideen have full control over more than 80% of the Afghan land, while Najceb in spite of Soviets military and financial support, has kept control of some important cities like, Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Jalalabad only.
    In regard to the recognition of
Interim government of Afghanistan, he was of the view that as the AIG is still lacking some international norms for recognition, the United States is, therefore, unable to extend its due recognition to AIG but, still continues support to Mujahideen.
    Tomsen added,"The decline of communism and other recent developments in Eastern Europe as well as in other parts of the world, enhanced the hope for the restoration of Afghan’s full independence.
