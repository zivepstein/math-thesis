    meaningless and not even worth watching it.
    The recent voting at the UN General Assembly shows that the world community has also seen through the Russian plots and does not take such shows seriously To those who still might be susceptible to the Russian political maneuvers we point out the following
    1 It is an established fact that more Ilian f>3% of Afghanistan is free from Russian domination Even if there had been free elections for the Jirga it would represent less than 13% of the country
    t Traditionally the members of Loya jirgas are not elected in general and free elections They are rather selected from among those in positions of power in their communities In the occupied areas the Red Army troops are the source of power and j have placed their puppets in power positions although the majority of the people hate them Thus n is natural that the puppet partv members and supporters become the Loya Jirga members in spite of the fact that they do not represent the views and sentiments of the majority of their constituencies
    3   The Constitution which the Loya Jirga is supposed to approve is full of contradictions and insures the rule of the Russian puppets in Afghanistan
    4 Even if the members of the Loya Jirga were true representatives of Afghan People and the proposed constitution was free of contradictions the presence of the Russian troops would constitute a source of intimidation for the memhersof the Jirga
    Any covenant or document approved under compulsion and force is legally null and void
 ! Thus, the so-called Loya*Jirga is nothing but a puppet show and a political maneuver Undoubtedly the achievements of the Jirga will he announced loud and strong by the ! Russians and their puppets
    None of the above however will bring about substantial changes in'the situation in Afghanistan or bring the problem closer to a solution
 j A genuine solution is only possible by the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ie, immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Afghanistan
                               AFGHANISTAN ANO THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT
 i Before starting the summit some people were thinking of some progress towards finding a political solution to the problem of Afghanistan The American side was saying that besides arms control regional issues would also be discussed in the summit
    for good reasons the Soviets were not interested in discussing the issue For them the main thing waste get the INF treaty signed The Americans on the other hand wanted to raise the issue but not to make it a a problem on the way of signing the INF treaty.
    After the summit Gorbachev who had achieved what he wanted repeated his previous stands on Afghanistan He called the war in Afghanistan a civil war (war between Afghans only) and conditioned the withdrawal of Soviet troops to what he called ! interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan
    Gorbachev did not seem to regret the role of that country in what he calls it the bleeding wound He seems determined to follow the policy of his predecessors which means continuation of the war
