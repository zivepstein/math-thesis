Anniversary of Soviet troops withdrawal
February 15 marks the first anniversary of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. It was a great victory for Afghans and all those who supported their cause and a major defeat for the Red Army and the Soviet Union's expansionist policies.
Unfortunately the withdrawal did not result in the restoration of peace through the exercise of the right of the Afghans to determine their future. The Kabul regime which was imposed on December 1979 by the Red Army remained in power and the Mujahideen had to continue their war of liberation against it.
The main obstacle in the way of peace is the Soviet attitude. That country has continued to support the illegal regime of Najibullah. The presence of Soviet advisors; support with great quantities of arms and ammunition and massive propaganda against the resistance are clear signs of Soviet determination to impose on Afghanistan a regime which will serve their strategic interests.
Against the expectation of the world community the Kabul regime survived at least for one year after the withdrawal. This was interpreted as a sign of weakness by the resistance and strength of the regime. These {developments have caused concern among some supporters of the resistance and they question their policy of support for the Mujahideen.
The survival of the regime has given a new hope to the Soviet Union and has made it less flexible in finding a political solution excluding the Kabul regime.
While the review of their Afghan policy by the supporters of the resistance in the light of new developments is understandable, their impatience and unreasonable expectations from the resistance should not form a base for a change of policy. The past under-estimation of the difficulties should not pave the way for fut ture mistakes.
At the same time the inflexible Soviet position should not be interpreted as that country's confidence in the regime winning the war. The Soviet Union must have learned a lesson from its temyears involvement in Afghanistan that the war in Afghanistan is not to be decided in one or two campaigns. One year's survival of the regime does not mean total victory for the Soviet puppets.
The past one year has taught many lessons to the resistance too. It showed that the resistance was facing a new political and military situation and its failure to unite its political ranks had a negative effect on its military efforts.
In the military field the Mujahideen faced a new type of war which needed re-organization, coordination and more supplies of arms and ammunition.
The events of last year taught the Mujahideen to act more carefully in battlefields, avoid battles they are not ready for and act together in order to get the desired result.
A quick study of military situation of the Kabul regime show.s that the basic weaknesses of the regime are: man power, terrain, popular support, total dependence on the Soviet Union and vulnerable transportation lines. These problems stops tlie enemy from taking any bold step to change the military situation in its favor.
The resistance, compared to the regime, is in a good position to win the war. In order to do this it has to re-organize itself and forge unity among different groups.
The supporters of the resistance should not be disappointed by the delay of victory because the war in Afghanistan has a protracted nature. If the Mujahideen are forced to shorten their time of action they will make irreparable mistakes. A political solution should be sought but not at the expense of a compromise on the right of Afghans to self-determination.
The Soviet Union does not have enough reasons to be optimistic. It has tested the patience of Afghans and might be aware of the hatred of Afghans towards the regime. The Soviet Union can not provide unlimited aid to the regime for an
unlimited period of time when it can not meet the basic needs of its own people.
Furthermore, the Soviet Union is facing tremendous problems at home and turmoil in Afghanistan will not help stability in their own country. The Soviet leaders know that the Kabul regime cannot bring peace to Afghanistan and supporting it only prolongs the war. It is in their best interest to give a chance to the Afghans-to choose their future and that is the only way to gain peace - and stability in Afghanistan. The international community should maintain pressure on the Soviet Union to stop supporting the "illegal regime" of Najibullah.
