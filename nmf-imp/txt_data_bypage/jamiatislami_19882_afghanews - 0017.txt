The main Mujahideen difficulty is long and difficult supply routes and ever-increasing transportation costs.
The economic situation in the area is not good. A lot of people have been displaced which need to be supported. Prices are high and in the absence of enough rain famine -will prevail.
Despite, all the difficulties the Mujahideen have been establishing new schools and clinics which are run by newly-trained Afghan doctors. They are helping both the Mujahideen and the people. Shortages of medicine is a problem.
                             THE ENDLESS MIGHTS OF THE VIETNAMESE
The war in Vietnam has ended officially but the suffering of its people still continues. Thousands of people accept the danger of being killed .in the sea to escape the tyranny of a dictatorship in their country.
The Vietnamese once had the sympathy of a lot of people for their continued struggle against foreign domination. When they gained their independence from foreign powers, they found themselves the prisoners of the system which had supported them. The regime in Vietnam has failed to give to its people what it was promising. More than that it has created new problems for its people by invading Cambodia and continuing an aggressive war for 8 years.
Refugees from Vietnam who escape by boats, deserve all sorts of humanitarian support to relieve their pains. It is also important that the international community should put pressure on the Vietnamese government to improve conditions so that these people under the regime would not be forced to choose the dangerous route of escaping by boats.
