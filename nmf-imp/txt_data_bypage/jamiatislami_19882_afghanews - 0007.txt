    The pressm Geneva sgresiBeiu also assumes that the people of Afghanistan .have done something wrong against the regime in Kabul and Torses a general amnesty by the regime and equal opportunities for work and travel (inside Afghanistan).with those who remained in iht country Ail these assumptions contradict with realities and any } agreement based on them should not fee expected to he veritable
    The Afghanistan problem , first of ail is a political issue which need.? a political approach based on the realities on the ground. The Mujahideen, as a determining factor j is a reality Any solution without involving them will not work. The question is • Is ] there any rote predicted in the present Geneva format for the Mujahideen to play’ The j answer is no. All the personal efforts of Mr. Cardovez to solve the big issue of involving ! the Mujahideen through private and informal talks is underestimating the dimensions ’ of the problem.                                                                 j
                                                                                                                       i
    Finally a stable government in the post-withdrawal period is a key to the issue and safeguard against any unpleasant developments in the form of interference in the affairs of Afghans A stable government is also necessary for a law and order situation and to avoid' an-necessary bloodshed How can one think of a stable government without full participation of the Mujahideen’ The puppets are not able to form such a government. Any figure from outside can not do that The key issue is involving the resistor ce in a political process,
  . Equally it is important to in elude the Soviets in direct talks with the Mujafcieteea.We -are j
    sure in that case there will not be too .many complicated problems which could not be solved.
    With ail the good intensions of our Pakistani brothers and the international community which supports the present Geneva talks unfortunately it is not adequate to solve the Afghan issue in its present form.
