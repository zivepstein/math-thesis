                    TO BE USEFULgE_A_.GOOD_MUSLXM
  - v iFor an Afghan to be a. .useful element in the Jehad against the Soviet invaders, he must be a good muslim,. In other words, a secular element, a so-called anti-Soviet leftest, an un-disciplined loose, liberal or a blind nationalist can not serve the cause of Jehad in an effective way,                                                  ,     .
     The question is why? the answer is simple. Islam has a dominating effect on all sides of an Afghan's life. Any element which does not agree totally with this    4
  way of thinking , faces the opposition of the masses whom he wants to serve. For such an element there is no position other than to adopt a two faced policy. On one hand he must show to his own people that he is a good muslim , on the other hand he must work covertly for his owxf aims. This type of man must hide in one1 Of the Islamic parties ;to protect himself while working through illegal means" to reach his undeclared aim . He is a saboteur in that party and makes its weak.
  We-have boen witness to., the weakening of some Mujahideen parties , as ..-a result of this type of infiltration. The effects of their work is .^..atjntrary. to the .interests of the people and useful for the enemy.More than that, when these people are rejected they feel frustrated and sometimes even join with the enemy to take revenge, 'SAMA1 is a good study case..                                                         ■
     Some foriegn elements and groups have tried to encourage these people and have even provided funds and moral support but with no success. The theories of some of these people may be appealing to some forie-gners but they are not acceptable to the people of Afghanistan and they will never succeed.
    Only a good muslim can be useful to the cause of the Jehad.
