Youth comes only once
I was once in the mosque at Damascus, enjoying a discussion with a group of scholars, when suddenly, a young man came in and asked: " Is there anyone here who speaks Persian?" They all pointed at me. " Is anything the matter?", I asked. The young man replied: "There is an old man, a hundred and fifty years old, on his deathbed. He is saying something in Persian which we cannot understand. If you would take the trouble to come with me, it might be profitable. Who knows, he might make a will."
When I reached his bedside, I heard him whispering: " Here I was, telling myself I would enjoy a relaxed old age, and now, I can’t even breathe! I had only just begun picking at life’s brightly colored buffet, and now they tell me to stop eating!"
I translated his words into Arabic for the Syrians. They were astonished that such an old man should express regret for the life of this world.
I asked the dying man: " How do you feel?" He replied :" What should I say; haven't you seen anyone having a tooth pulled out? Then imagine what it is like to have your soul tom out of your dear body!"
I told him:" Don't allow the image of death to obsess you and stop letting your imagination disrupt your physical balance. The Greek doctors say: Though the four humors are evenly balanced in your body, do not think it can last for ever. However frightful the disease, never give up all hope of recovery.’ If you agree, I will call a doctor to treat you, and you may get better."
"Alas!", he said. " The fat trader dreams of adding vast, pillared porticoes to his house, forgetting that the foundations are rotten. The old man groans in his death agony while the old woman massages him with oil. When the balanced temperement or immune system finally collapses, neither pills nor charms will do any good."
Appreciate what you have
I had never complained about my fortune nor ever frowned at the revolutions of the stars, until one day my shoes wore out; I could not afford to buy new footwear and had to go barefoot. Grumbling and depressed, I wandered into the mosque at Kufa. There I saw a man who had lost both his feet At once, I thanked God and praised
Ugly voice hurts a noble cause
There was a man who had an ugly voice. He used to chant the Quran at the top of his voice. A wise man passed by and asked him: " What is your monthly stipend?" The man replied: ’’ I receive nothing."
’’ Then why do you give yourself so much trouble?"
’’ I chant for the love of God."
" Then for the love of God, shut up! When you chant the Quran the way you do, you hideously disfigure the beauty of Islam."
Him and resolved to bear patiently my lack of shoes.
A man who has eaten too much looks at roast chicken indifferently as if it were a lettuce leaf; a poor man who is hungry looks at a boiled turnip with as much longing as if it were roast chicken.
