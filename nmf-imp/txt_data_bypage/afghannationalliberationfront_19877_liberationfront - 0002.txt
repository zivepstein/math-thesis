Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged : and Allah is indeed able to give them victory:
Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: our lord is Allah — for had it not been for Allah's repelling some men by means of others, cloisters and churches and oratories, and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is <qten mentioned, would assuredly have
been pulled down. Verily Allah help one who help him. Lo! Adah is Strong, Almighty.
