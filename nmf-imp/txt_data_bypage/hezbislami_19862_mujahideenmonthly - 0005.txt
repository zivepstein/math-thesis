THE FEZ CONFERENCE
The organization of the Islamic Conference in its 16th session held in the ancient Moroccan city of Fez considered more than one hundred issues, with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan being among those at the top of the agenda.
The OIC's stand on Russia's brutal and naked aggression on Afghanistan was "made dear at an extraordinary sessibn held in Islamabad in January 1980.
At the session the OIC adopted a well-known 11 point policy on the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Among other things it called for the restoration of the Islamic character of Afghanistan, its non-aligned status and ensuring the right of the Afghan refugees to return to their country with dignity and honour.
The conference also demanded that the Afghan nation must have the right to self-
determination and suggested that a three member standing committee be formed to follow up the issue to its just solution.
Since then the OIC stands with regards to Afghanistan is by and large commendable, however its resolutions seem to be stronger in rhetoric than in action.
The Russians are aware of the soft approach of the OIC. Particularly of those member countries who continue to develop their economic, cultural, military and political ties with Moscow.
The result of the Soviets' over-all strategies in the region is dear now for all to see and the Russians are no longer hiding their ambitions in the region.
While the Russians are forcing the people of Afghanistan to leave their land — using murderous techniques including massacres, chemical agents and the destruction of crops — they are trying desperately to tighten their grip on the country by building barracks
