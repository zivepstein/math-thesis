AFGHAN fEUS VOL.lit, NO.5, 1/3/ 19B7 PAGE 7
   All those who study events closely, understands that the puppet regime in Afghanistan came to power with help of the Soviet troops. This is not also difficult to realize that after seven years of war that regime is not able to survive if 150, 000 Soviets troops stop to supporting it
   The popularity of the resistance and the support of the absolute majority of Afghan people to the cause of freedom is a fact It is also true that the resistance is not confined in a region or among a section of the people . 80% of the land and the majority of the population is controlled by the Mujahideen. If there were not the overwhelming support of the people the resistance would have been crushed by the Red Army long time ago.
   Puppet regime on the other hand does not have a natural base among the people of v Afghanistan Its army is composed of press-ganged conscripts who hunt for an early opportunity to escape The puppets administration is tightly controlled by the Soviets at all levels Puppets are like a mouthpiece; say what they are told to say and do what they are told to do.                                                                -

They are supported by the Soviets and its satellites Through this support it has been able to be a member of the UN and NAM and have normal trade and diplomatic relationship with rest of the world including neighboring countries like Iran .Pakistan, China , Western Europe and United states of America For those who are not fully aware of the real situation the outside image of the regime is confusing They think that war is a civil war and Mujahideen are rebels
   The war in Afghanistan is a liberation war with the people in one side and the Soviets in the other side The role of the regime is not more than local guides, informers and
