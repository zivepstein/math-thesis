Pepsi added to Afghan menu
The Kabul regime has promised Pepsi Cola a monopoly of the soft drink market in Afghanistan when a plant set up under franchise from the American giant starts producing next month, AFP reported.
Qadir and Wazir Resin Processing Co.( QWO), a private company, has set up the plant under the Pepsi International franchise.
Although fighting is continuing between Soviet-backed government forces and resistance guerillas in many parts of the country, the Pepsi marketing venture is considered one of the most ambitious commercial projects ever launched in the country.
QWO plans to step up its annual production to a target 69 million bottles for three brands - Pepsi, Miranda and 7-Up.
The company's chief engineer Nooruddin said the firm's Pepsi will be cheaper than those sold on die market now, but its fixed cost will depend on the rate of the Afghani against the US dollar.
Imported colas, including the Soviet GI and staple SISI, presently sell at between 450 and 500 Afghanis a can and the Pepsi makers said they would sell their brands at below 30 cents US, or 300 Afghanis.
The Pepsi project is fail proof because it bagged the franchise the same year as Coca Cola withdrew its license here after letting an Afghan manufacturing firm produce and market the drink for 20 years.
Pepsi International has agreed only to supply formula concentrates while QWO will stock its own chemicals sugar and water to prepare the three drinks.
