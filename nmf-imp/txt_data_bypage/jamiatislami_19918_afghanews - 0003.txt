Babrak claims opposing Soviet invasion of 1979
Babrak Karmal, the former head of the Kabul regime, has claimed that he was opposed to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
In his first interview after spending four years in exile in Moscow, he said he tendered his resignation from the jarty leadership several times but the larty rejected it.
Babrak, 62, was brought to power by the Red Army in 1979 and acted as the president of Afghanistan in the shadow of occupation forces till 1986. He was replaced by Najib, the chief of the regime's secret police (KHAD), and one year later, he was sent into exile under the cover of medical treatment.
He described himself as a patriot and expressed support for western style democratic system in Afghanistan.
Describing the last ten years of the former king's role as "golden era”, he did not oppose the return of the king if the majority of Afghans wanted him.
Commenting on his role in the current crises, Babrak said everyone in Afghanistan bore some responsibility for the situation. He described his life in exile as torture.
A spokesman of Watan Party has said Babrak has returned as an ordinary citizen and the party has ignored his return. Babrak has some supporters in Watan Party and his return might intensify differences among the party. Mahmood Baryalai, Babrak's brother, was sacked from his post of Deputy Prime Minister before the arrival of Babrak.
Another communist leader, Sultan Ali Keshtmand, also has returned from Moscow. He has served as the Prime Minister of the Kabul regime twice — once during Soviet occupation and the second time after the Soviet troops withdrawal. Keshtmand lived in exile in Soviet Union since June 1990.
Keshtmand announced his resignation from the ruling party a few days ago.
He gave the following reasons for his resignation:
•	Improper treatment of ethnic minorities by the party. He said this was the main reason for his resignation.
•Absence of democracy in the country, despite drastic changes in favor of democracy in the world.
•Divisions within the ruling party which has discredited it in the eyes of the people.
•	Lack of collective leadership and democracy in the party.
Soviets brought Babrak to Kabul in 1979 and sent him to exile in 1987. He is sent again to play a new role!
•Ineffective approach of the party to the national reconciliation issue.
Talking to BBC he elaborated that the ethnic groups should be given a share in the leadership proportionate to the size of their population . He supported the demand of Shia Mujahideen parties for. one third representation in any body. He claimed that Shias formed one third of the population of country. He said while his objectives are. similar to those of Shia parties, he has no organizational relations with them.
Keshtmand is from Hazarajat and his family belonged to Shia sect. He has always tried to make use oftfls ethnic connection to serve his political aims. He has been active during the Soviet occupation to create militia groups from among Hazaras.

Afghanski wins vice presidency
When Russian Republic leader Boris Yeltsin needed a vice-presidential running mate, he picked an Afghan war hero and Communist Party maverick, Alexander V. Rutskoi who had saved Yeltsin from a challenge by hard-line lawmakers earlier this year.
Rutskoi has been honored as a Hero of the Soviet Union for service in Afghanistan as a fighter pilot.
A longtime party member, Rutskoi says hard-line leaders are out of step with the times.
