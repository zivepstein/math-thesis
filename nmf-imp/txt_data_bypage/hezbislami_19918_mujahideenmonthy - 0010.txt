oppressive socio-political structure. It is always very rare to find any one today aiming high at destroying this rotten system and building in its stead a dynamic and productive Islamic Afghanistan.
Our Muslim revolutionary struggle therefore is striving towards breaking the imperialist monopoly of domination over the country. Its two puppet allies of imposed Marxist regime and brain-washed, half-baked intellectuals are therefore going to face the toughest part of the contemporary ideological challenge. Afghanistan wants to vacate its almost permanent seat in the outcast group or poverty-striken class of the so-called Third World.
This is the hope today and we should try as best as we could to recast our memory and vacate our steps in knowing why exactly generations after generations were denied. The entire country was plundered from east and west. Men women, children and aged were thrown into valleys of denial and brutally beaten into submission by the so-called traditional values of the society without justification in a manner hardly surpassed in history.
We don’t want things to remain so and this is why the entire population must be thought how to countinue in living for constructive principles and not returning to the era of selfish interests. Not to teach this vigorously to our selves and hammer it into the minds of the children is to mortgage our lives and further generations to neo-colonialists and nuclear age imperialists.
For these all we need a revived revolutionary understanding of Islam as a dynamic system of life and simultaneously reject completely that conservative religious way of thinking that seek to protect oppression in the name of faith.
The next step therefore is to fight this tradional way of doing things with, the same vigour if not with a greater strength by which we are now combating the puppet regime in Kabul. The reason for this is obvious. Since if we are successful in removing foreign stooges represented by the Marxist-secularist alliance party, the act of reconstructing the country would be rendered impossible if the socio-political system itself docs not witness a real fundamental changes.
In the world generally and as it is in Afghanistan particularly it is extremely difficult for any tyrant or despot to maintain its rule of terror and totalitarianism
without having recourse to a permissible cultural base that keeps him and his heartless court in power.
This system is therefore the main enemy and not the ruler, in as much as the former in most cases does not only create the latter but also guarantees a perpetuation of oppressive rule through his progeny for many

Peshawar: Afghan Mujahideen in one of their massive joint operation in Logar province of Afghanistan Friday night claimed to have recaptured their lost positions, reports (ANA). Wireless reports of Mujahideen disclosed that they launched joint attacks on regime’s strong-holds all over the province.
In the two-hour nightoffensives. Mujahideen captured a part of the Tangi Waghjan, Kunjak Hospital, Patho Ghundai, Niazi area and the former base of Lushkar Esar at Tangi Waghjan.
Mujahideen were reported to be in position of the captured areas, while indiscriminate bombings continued on their trenches.
After captured these areas, Mujahideen unleashed heavy artillery fire on regime’s installations at the capital of the province, Ali Malang area, upper Tangi Waghjan and certain parts of Mohammad Agha district.
The regime forces were also returning Mujahideen fire, however Mujahideen claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on the regime troops. Casualty figures of the regime forces could not be estimated immediately.
Four group commanders alongwith some Mujahideen are reported to have embraced martyrdom in these fighting. Their names could not be ascertained immediately. Fierce fighting was reported at different fronts between Mujahideen and the regime forces.
Mujahideen have formed local Shoora for the supervision of these operations, which include the Mohammad Agha and Kulangar Shooras. Steps were also being taken to close the Kabul-Logar highway by Mujahideen. The highway if closed will ease pressure on Mujahideen forces.
The joint attack on regime forces in Logar is a prelude to Mujahideen offensives in Nangarhar, Paktia, Kabul, Kandahar and other major cities under the regime control.
