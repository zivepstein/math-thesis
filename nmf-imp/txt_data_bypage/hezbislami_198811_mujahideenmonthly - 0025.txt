AN OPEN LETTER
i—
TO GORBACHEV
Vladimir Ramchuk, 20, from Brozna in the Ukraine, defected from the Soviet army in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, on December 19, 1985. Taking his arms and ammunition he surrendered to the local commander of the Hezb-e Islam i whose name and location he had heard from Afghan army officers. He does not wish to return to his	Russian-occupied
Ukraine, and got political
asylum in the U.S.A.
While still at a technical school in Brozna, Ramchuk was conscripted by a special army team which regularly visits colleges and high schools. He was whisked off to Volga by the army recruiting officers the day he was suddenly summnoned to the principal's office in March 1985. After eight months' training, with special emphasis on
meterology, he was airlifted first to Kabul and then to Jalalabad. His father, a driver, and mother, a worker in a chemical laboratory, were not informed that Ramchuk was being taken into the army for service in Afghanistna. All he himself was told-as indeed all the other Soviet soldiers-was that he would be fighting Americans, Pakistanis and Iranians in Afghanistan.

RESPECTED

GORBACHEV
I heard about a great miracle which happened in the country of ’locked doors' and legalized lawlessness, that is openness’ (glasnost). There are rumours that apparently it has become possible there [in that country] to talk about everything and everybody. All kinds of problems are now being decided and subsequently	publicised.
Therefore, I have decided to share some of my problems with you, as I am wholeheartedly concerned with them. As I am a single person, I will explain myself in a simple language, I trust you will not judge me too
