In the name of Allah, the Beneficient, the Merciful
Have they not traveled in the land to set the nature of the consequence for those who disbelived, before them? They were mightier than these in power ana (in the) traces (which th^y left behind them) in the earth. Yet Allah seized them for their sins, and they had no protector from Allah.
Mr. President and distingu shed delegates:
Allow me to voice the anguish of an oppressed nation which is in flames because of an inhuman and devastating war imposed on it for seven years. The Afghan nation is undergoing untold misery and unparalleled savagery throughout its homeland, following blatant Soviet . aggression on this weak and small neighboring state which has refused to succumb to her subjugation. We have incurred more than 1.1 million lives as martyrs, another 4.5 million people have become refugees and our valleys and plains are echoing with the horrid roars of tanks, artillery and bomb blasts and the screams of dying . women and; children at the hands-of murderous Soviet
forces, as this august body is engaged in deliberating international peace and tranquility.
In spite of extreme distress and unimaginable handicaps, our nation is waging heroic resistance, with patience and fortitude, against a far more superior power. We have shattered the myth of the invincibility of the Red Army. We are determined to continue this struggle until we achieve total independence. And under no circums-stances shall we bow before the dastardly enemy.
By mvading Afghanistan, the Soviet/Marxist monster has actually exposed its dreadful and despicable teeth concealed behind the smokescreen of defending the workers, peasants a*d deprived, who ironically became the first target of Soviet brutalities. The huts and homes of our downtrodden people have been razed to the ground by Soviet tanks, heavy artillery and ceaseless bombardment. Indiscriminate destruction has .been unleashed all over Afghanistan. Our children and infants have been sadistically bayoneted to death before stunned parents. Our women and aged are oeing gunned down for the participation of their sons in resistance. Our crops,
--------------7----------------------
orchards, foodstocks and forests in Liberated Areas are set ablaze through . aerial assaults and our water supplies poisoned. Our refugee caravans, comprised of people whose homes have been destroyed and whose belongings stolen and who could no longer survive under the towering Hindukush- mountains and steep valleys, are repeatedly wiped out by merciless bombing and helicopter ggnship strafing. Thus after seven years of war the refugee exodus is not only continuing but has actually increased. Moreover, Soviet terrorism has not even spared refugees in Pakistan. Refugees are frequently killed in cross-border bombings and Soviet agents have been poisoning the water supplies of the refugees.
In their bid to crush the resistance of our brave people, the Russian aggressors have refrained from no crimes and used all kinds of lethal and universally prohibited weapons- such as naplam bombs, dumdum bulets, poisonous gases, chemical weapons, booby traps and cluster bombs on a large scale Both youngsters and elderly people are forcibly taken away for military conscription. Small children are being systematically abducted and sent to nurseries all over the Soviet
