                                        GORBACHOV VISITED INDIA
 The Soviet leader paid a 4 day official visit to India starting from Nov, 25th Before beginning his visit, Gorbachov tried to disarm the mass media by saying that proximity talks under the auspices of the UN are making progress. He even vent further to say that the Soveit Union vas in favor of a free, independent and non-aligned Afghanistan with a friendly regime vith the USSR
 This last condition , the friendship of the regime in Kabul with the USSR reveals the true intentions of the Soviets in Afghanistan The Soviet leader wanted to say that the choice of leadership in Kabul lies with them not the people of Afghanistan
 Gorbachov also tried to decieve world opinion by saying that if America and Pakistan reciprocated the good-will of the USSR there would be a solution to the problem of * Afghanistan
 The world clearly knows how the Afghanistan problem was created by the Soviets. The . People of Afghanistan were opposing a regime which had come to power by a coup and was a dictatorship This was their internal problem
 In December 1979 the Soviets intervened in favor of a communist faction and a totally new situation was created Since that lime war has continued between the people of Afghanistan and the Red Army which is supported by a handful of domestic communists
 We do not see how the Soviets equate themselves with Pakistan and the USA in the war of Afgnanistan.If the Soviets call the humanitarian assistance to the refugees and voting for the UN resolutions intervention they could not^convince any wise and sound person
 When Gorbachov was in India he talked about the need to strengthen the UN organization We do not understand how an organization could be strenglhend if all the resolutions passed by the majority of its members is ignored by a super power member If the Soviet Union want to see in the UN, a body with no morality to criticize war-mongering powers then that is the end of the life of this body
 Rajiv, the prime minister of India welcomed Govbachov with a fanfare and praised him for his commitment to Peace He said Respect our Non-AlignmentO) we respect your commitment to peace!!)"
 The realities of Afghanistan expose the nature of both. Indian Non-Alignment and the Soviet commitment to peace
 In order to get more economic and military support India speaks against the principles of Non-Alignment and does not vote for the soft and un-named resolutions of the UN and other international fora which ask for the withdrawal of foreign (Soviet) troops from Non-Aligned Afghanistan To call yourself Non-Aligned and do not condemn the invasion of aNon-Alinged country is the paradox of Indian neutrality
 Similarly invading a country and the continuation of war for seven years killing half a million and driving out 5 million others is evidence of the commitment of the Soviet leaders to peace
 Another important feature of this trip was the extra ordinary security measues taken by the Indians and Soviets themselves 32 thousand Indian police force were not enough and Gorbachov brought 400 more with bullet proof cars Why do they feel so insecure? We have a saying traitor feels insecure' This is a new phenomenon for the Soviet leaders This is the price they are paying for their aggression in Afghanistan
 When Gorbachov left India the text of his speach in which he had attacked religious people was published in Moscow Attacks on religion,( Islam) is a sign of the frustration of the communist leader who is facing the opposition of faithful Muslims abroad and at
