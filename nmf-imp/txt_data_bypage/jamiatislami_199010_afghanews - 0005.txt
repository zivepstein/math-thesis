US, USSR Afghan talks make no
The talks between the US and Soviet officials failed to bridge the gap between the positions of the two sides on Afghanistan.
Both side agree on solving the problem through holding elections in which all sides in the conflict should be allowed to participate. They also agree about a transitional period during which a new administration is formed to supervise the elections.
The United States wants the Kabul regime to transfer power to the interim administration but the Soviets want to see Najib in power during the transitional period and are in favor of creation of a joint commission from both side to supervise the elections.
In short, the role of Najib and PDPA during the transitional period is a controversial issue.
While the position of the Kabul regime is similar to the Soviet Union, the Mujahideen position differ from Americans.
The Mujahideen are opposed not only to the rule of Najib and PDPA in transitional phase, they are also opposed to the participation of Najib and PDPA in the future political life of the country. The Mujahideen hold the regime responsible for the invasion and destruction of the country and have refused to deal with it.
Any agreement between the superpowers that involve the participation of Najib and PDPA will be rejected by the majority of the resistance groups.
The UN Secretary General in his annual report, released before the Opening of the 45th session of the General Assembly, has said that progress has been made in the direction of consensus at the international level on a politi-
progress
cal settlement in Afghanistan among the US, USSR and the neighbors of Afghanistan. He said he has made it clear to all the leaders of Afghanistan that the UN was ready to play a role in the political process leading to formation of broad-based government.
The Kabul regime's effort to secure the position of a vice-president of the General Assembly was thwarted by Pakistan.
Twenty-one vice-presidents are chosen to run the session when the president is not present.
Informed sources say the US and USSR will propose a consensus resolution to the current session of the General Assembly which calls for holding elections as a mean for political solution.
Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati told the General Assembly that because of religious, cultural and historical ties Iran cannot remain indifferent about the fate of Afghans.
He said Afghanistan should emerge as a free Islamic and non-aligned country. This will be possible when all Afghans participate in general elections and the results of the elections are accepted.
He said the elections should be held under supervision of the UN, and added that the Namibia experience can be useful.
He said Iran was ready to assist in the implementation of the election process. Observers believe that Iran is not opposed to the participation of PDPA in General Elections. But the Iran-based parties say they oppose the participation of communists in any future government of Afghanistan.
