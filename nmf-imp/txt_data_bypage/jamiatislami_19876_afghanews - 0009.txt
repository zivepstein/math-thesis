 religious movements in Afghanistan prior to 1947, and the subsequent growth of vhat he terms the Islamist movement. Composed mainly of modernist intellectuals rather than the traditional clergy and fervently opposed to the spread of communist ideology, this group set out to define Islam in terms of its relation to the state and to "develop a modern political ideology based on Islam, which they see as the only way to come to terms with the modern world and the best means of confronting foreign imperialism".
 The author proceeds to analyse in some detail the communist attempts at force-fed reform in the countryside, the uprisings they triggered and the savage repression unleashed by the beleaguered Marxist regime in Kabul. In the second half of the book Roy goes on to consider the evolution of resistance in the light of the ethnic and social backgrounds of the various parties, its military structure and its operational capabilities, Particularly useful here as indeed throughout the book, is Roy s attention to Afghanistan s Sheeya minority, mostly ethnic Hazaras, often overlooked by Western* writers to the advantage of the more numerous Sunni factions
 What makes Roy s analysis of the resistance notably more penetrating than other studies is its grasp and exposition of the movement's underlying socio-political structures, as well as its attention to detail He addresses such issues as the types of weapons used, problems of guerrilla logistics,the impact of the war on nomadic life and treatment of Soviet prisoners -
 Central to Roy s analysis of the war and its future course is the tension between the essentially divisive facets of Afghan society, The main poles, primary loyalty to local community on the one hand, and, on the other, forces of Islamic modernism and a new nationalism born in the crucible of war These latter forces, which promote social and military cohesion, Roy sees as championed largely by the Islamist party of Jamiat-i-Islami strong across much of the north and west, and spearheaded by the new politico-military forms of organization evolved under guerrilla leader Ahmadshah Massoud in the northeastern quadrant of Afghanistan, It is the Tajik. Uzbek and Turkman north argues the author that will prove far more crucial to the development of the resistance than the mostly tribal, Pushtun south, where territorial jealousies tend to inhibit the growth of broadbased politico-military organizations
 On the whole, the translation from the French reads fluently However it is flawed by a surprising number of typographical errors the odd grammatical mistake and occasional outright errors of translation (e g trellis or military fatigues, as worn by central resistance units-rendered somewhat incongruously as denim') More serious is the failure to reproduce the four maps of the original edition showing Afghanistan s topography, provincial divisions, patterns of ethnic distribution and the spread of resistance parties influence In a work that dwells largely on ethnic and regional differences the omission of maps is a curious and irritating one. None of that, however should be permitted to detract from the overall excellence of a work of scholarship that has already become required reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in Afghanistan
