Glimpses into the historical background of	Part(4)
The Islamic Movement in Afghanistan
After receiving doctorate degree in Fiqh methodology from Al-Azhar University, I returned to Kabul in 1972 and was appointed as professor in Faculty of Shariat, Kabul University. I was not unfamiliar with the the situation of the Movement. The reason was that I was in constant touch with the brothers in Afghanistan while I was in Egypt My information was in such detail that I knew the names as well as some characteristics of many members who had joined the Movement after I had left Kabul. Thus, immediately we became close friends and companions for fulfilling our great religious duty.
found the atmosphere ripe for fast and significant developments in the history of the Movement. So far, the work had progressed under leadership of a number of the professors of the Faculty of Shariat and some prominent students from various faculties without any formal organization. Martyred Prof. Ghulam Mohammad Niazi was generally recognized as the head of the Movement. Shortly after my arrival, however, the following developments took place:
A- Some professors of the Faculty of Shariat and a number of prominent personalities among the students gathered together in Prof. Rabbani's house to discuss the organizational format of the Movement They were: (1) Prof. Rabbani (2) Martyred Eng. Habibur Rahman, (3) Prof. Abdur Rkb Rasul Sayyaf, (4) Martyred Mawlawi Habibur Rahman, (5) Martyred Eng. Saifuddin,
(6)	Martyred Sayyed Abdur Rahman,
(7)	Martyred Prof. Abdul Qader Tawana, (8) Qazi Abdul Bari, (9) Said Noorullah Emad, (10) Mohammad Jan Ahmadzai, (11) Sayyed Enayatullah Shadab, (12) the writer.
The group decided the following:
(1)	Formation of a leadership council consisting of the present members and two other brothers who were not present, i.e., Hikmatyar and Martyred Dr. Mohammad Omar.
(2)	Division of work among the prominent members of the Movement as the following:
-Prof. Rabbani as the leader and chairman of the leadership council,
-Prof. Sayyaf as deputy leader,
-Eng Habibur Rahman as secretary and in charge of military affairs
Memoirs of Dr. Tawana
(we considered the secretary as the third ranking person),
-Eng. Saifuddin Nasratyar in charge of organizing the youth,
•Mawlawi Habibur Rahman in charge of organizing the Ulama (religious scholars) and relationship with them,
-Said Abdur rahman in charge of
finance,
-Martyred Prof. Abdul Qader Tawana in charge of the organization in Balkh province,
- Qazi Abdul Bari in charge of relations with workers and farmers and organizing their affairs,
-Sayyed Noorullah Emad in charge of the organization in Herat province,
-I was put in charge of cultural affairs. Enayatullah Shadab and Ahmadzai were appointed my assistants.
It should be noted that Eng. Hikmatyar and Dr. Mohammad Omar were in jail at that time. It was decided that they would be in charge of political activities after their release. In a seperate meeting in which Prof. Rabbani, Eng Habibur Rahman, prof. Niazi, I and some other members from outside the University were present, it was decided that Prof. Niazi would supervise the political section.
Some points need clarification about what is mentioned above:
1.	Various duties and authorities were not clearly delimited.
2.	Brothers found it advisable for Prof. Niazi to refrain from participation in our meetings and limit his contact to the organization through Prof. Rabbani and few others. It was felt that he would be in a better position to defend Islamic Movement from his official position as the chairman of the Faculty of Shariat Prof. Niazi himself was of the same views.
3.	The above mentioned list does not include all the prominent personalities active in the Movement. For example:
-Abdur Rahim Niazi who was one of the most active and prominent student members of the Movement had passed away before the first organizational meeting was held. Therefore, his name is not in the list.
-Martyred Ghulam Rabbani Ateesh was also an active and prominent member. I do not recall, however, whether he was present in the first meeting and
was put in charge of some task or not
-Soofi Qurban Mohammad was the most active person tor the Islamic cause in Kabul University in 1965-67. During the first organizational meeting, however, he was out of Kabul. There were also some other active members who were out of the country at that time.
-There were a number of members who had left the Movement by the time of the first organizational meeting. They had joined the ranks of the enemies of the Movement They are not included in the above list either.
B- Members of the leadership council selected the name "Jami'at Islami", (Islamic Society) for their blessed Movement in the first organizational meeting. Being more concerned with action that name and also being cautious about the Government's anti-religious persecution had made the founding members of the Movement not to adopt any name.
When the Movement grew among the students and they began having public meetings, the young members of the Movement called themselves "Jawanan Musulman" (Muslim Youths). Others, and especially the enemies, however, used to call them "Ikhwan Muslimeen” (Muslim Brotherhood). I do not have any idea who first used these two names.
I recall very well that a number of us discussed the issue of selecting a name for the Movement in one of the classrooms of the Faculty of Shariat. We selected the name "Jamiat" because it resembled the word "Jamaat" in the name of "Jamaat Ikhwan Muslemeen" of Egypt and "Jamaat Islami" of Pakistan but was also distinct from both.
There were no significant differences among us at that time. I had heard, though, some brothers speaking about seeing the first signs of differences among some members. Eng. Habibur Rahman had noticed that first. It is not advisable to talk about the issue in detail at this point of time.
C- Each brother had made written commitment that he would work for the supremacy of the word of God, he would oppose the enemies of God's religion, he would obey the orders of the leadership willingly whether he liked
