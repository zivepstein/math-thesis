towards adherents of other faiths is to be found in the chapter which was granted to the Jews by the Holy Prophet after his arrival in Madina, and in the message which he sent to the Christians of the Najran, a town in Southern Arabia, then largely inhabited by Christians after Islam had fully established itself in the Arab Peninsula.
“ In the name of most Merciful and Compassionate God,” says this first chapter of freedom of conscience, “Given by Muhammad, the Holy Prophet, to the believers, whether of the Qureish or of Yathrib” as Madina was then called—and to all individuals, of whatever origin who have made common cause with them: All these shall constitute one nation...The Jews who
attach themselves to our common wealth shall be protected from all insults and vexations: They shall have an equal right with our people to our assistance and good offices. The Jews of the various branches— (and here follows the names of the various Jewish tribes of Madina and the surrounding territories)—and all others domiciled in Yathrib, shall form with the Muslims one composite nation; they shall practise their religion as freely as the Muslims; the clients— meaning the protected, and the allies of the Jews shall enjoy the same security and freedom.” This was a paraphrase of the Charter granted by the Holy Prophet to the Jews after he had arrived in Yathrib, a town which because of him became known as Madinat-un-Nabi—the city of the Holy Prophet, or in short, Madina, while the message to the Christians of Najran, sent to them almost at the end of the Holy Prophet’s mission, runs as follows:
“To the Christians of Najran and the neighboring territories the security of God and the pledge of his Prophet are extended for their lives, their religion and their property—to the present as well as the absent and others besides; there shall be no interference with the practice of their faith or their observances; nor any change in then-rights or privileges; no bishop shall be removed from his bishopric; nor any monk from his priesthood, and they shall continue to enjoy everything great and small as heretofore; no image or cross shall be destroyed they shall not practice the rights of blood vengeance as in the days of ignorance— (the era before the advent of Islam); no tithes shall be levied from them nor shall they be required to furnish provisions for the troops."
If there been instances of religious intolerance in the history of the Muslim nations, these instances—and that should be very clearly understood —did not happen because of Islam but inspite of Islam and they only betray lack of knowledge of the teachings of Islam, and of understanding of the spirit and principles of that region.
Equality in Action
I certainly cannot and shall not claim that the idea of racial equality and of human brotherhood is the invention of Islam and has only been proclaimed by thatreligion and by nobody else. But I claim and insist that only in and through Islam has this idea ever been realized in action over centuries and among the most different and dissimilar nations and races.
Inspite of the lofty ideals of
Enlightenment and of the French Revolution the West did not and has still not solved the racial problem, not has the West been able until today to establish racial equality everywhere in its hemisphere. It is barely thirty years ago that racism was raised to the position of state philosophy—themostbrutal and barbaric racism that can be imagined the one I referred to the very beginning of my talk, was crushed in my own country. Racism in the shape of “Apartheid” is still allowed to raise its ugly head in South Africa, and racism has certainly not been eradicated in the United States inspite of the abolition of slavery that took place some time ago and inspite of legislation introduced after the Second World War, aiming at the levelling of differences among the various racial groups and at the doing away with racial discrimination. In the Socialist world, Marxism Leninism of Communism has introduced its own brand and type of racism— namely what I may be permitted to call “Ideological Racism” which is as hateful and abhorrent as biological racism. So wherever we look we find that neither the ideals of age of Enlightenment nor of the French Revolution, nor the UN Charter of Human Rights, the latest exercise in bringing about racial equality and in abolishing racial discrimination, has been able to achieve its goal, while Islam has most certainly done so.
The Success of Islam
Why, then has Islam succeeded where other systems and ideologies seem to have failed? What is the secret of its success, and in what way can be solution of the racial problem under which millions and millions of our fellow human-beings are still reeling?
In my humble opinion Islam has succeeded where other systems and ideologies have failed because of two decisive factors: namely the universality of its teachings and the divine sanction on which the Islamic concept of the brotherhood of mankind is based.
A Muslim believes that Islam is not only the last of the world’s great religions but also an all-inclusive religions which went before it. It is one of its most striking characteristics that it requires its followers to believe that all great religions of the world that preceded it have been revealed by God, and it is a fundamental principle of Islam that a Muslim must also believe in all prophets who were raised up before the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBOH).
