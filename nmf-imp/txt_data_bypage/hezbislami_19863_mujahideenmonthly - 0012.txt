want to terrify the people of Afghanistan by killing and looting, but the Russians should know that Afghanistan has never been con-qurered by anybody and no nation has controlled this country. The people of Afghanistan have proudly avowed that they love to accept death, but will not accept Soviet slavery.
Let the Russian bloodthirsty forces wait for their victory in Afghanistan. Definite defeat is awaiting them. ''Afghanistan is the land of Muslims and Islam is the faith of this nation." One of the Mujahideen during discussion told me that yes, it is true that the Aggressive Russian forces have been defeated disgracefully. Even in face to face fighting the Russian forces are using helicopters and modern bombers, but victory is always on the side of the Mujahideen.
The government forces of Afghanistan are decreasing and even sections, companies and brigades have joined the Mujahideen. These soldiers do not want to fight against their own people. They do not want to kill their brothers and sisters. These soldiers are not allowed to perform their religious activities in the barracks. They have been deprived of their faith, for which they are sacrificing the whole of their life.
Communists under the leadership of Soviet puppet, Babrak Karmal, have taken refuge in the big cities and there they are living under the shadow of Russian soJdiers. Even they are afraid in the streets and roads and without bodyguards they cannot go out. This is because they know that the Mujahideen have influence in the cities.

Mujahideen at the cost of their lives not only kill the invading forces of Russia, but they kill their quisling servants as well.
