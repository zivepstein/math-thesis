 economic and logestic problems we are, thanks God, successful in pur efforts.
 Q. How are you financed?
 A. The biggest financial source is the people themselves. We get Usher(Ten percent of the harvest) from people. Those who work in the cities in the government offices give us voluntarily five percent of their salary .Mines like salt lapiz and emerald are in our control which we sell in the world market.And lastly the easiest financial source are the enemy convoys which bring food and other things from the Soviet Union. We capture both money and commoditities from these convoys.
 Q. Do Afghan refugees return to Afghanistan while the Russians are still here?

    2)  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
    As long as these two reasons are there refugees will never return.

 A. It is not true. You know better that there is no time for such things.
 Q. For eight years you have been fighting against the SovietsJIave you ever thought of giving up and surrendering?
 A. It is the enemy which should give up. Russia is condemned by world public opinion and political and economic pressures have increased on them, Soviet losses are high and this has an effect in its people.The Puppet regime in Kabul is in a critical position. Parcham and Khalq parties are fighting against each other. Najib’s comming to power has worsened the situation. From all this you can judge yourself is this the time for fighting or giving up?
