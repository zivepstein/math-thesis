 who are in search of ways and means for the political settlement of the Afghan issue, and cordialy welcome those friendly and peace loving nations who assist the Afghan Mujahideen and Muhqjireen, politically, economically and militarily, merely on humanitarian bases.
     / would also like to draw the attention of all of you once again, that whatever, we do and struggle for, is to liberate Afghanistan in accordance with the wishes of the Afghan        Mujahid nation, and whatever, we expect from
 our friends and freedom loving nations in our struggle and just cause is, to support us without pre-terms and conditions. This is our policy which we strictly follow since the begin ing of our Jehad against the Soviet Social
 Imperialism.
     However, those who are against the political settlement of the Afghan issue and the assistance from the peace loving nations to the Afghan Mujahideen and Muhajireen under the aforementioned circumstances may actually not be desirous to settle the Afghan problem and to fetum to their homeland with peace and honour.
 GOVERNMENT IN EXILE
     Though, a lot of work has been done through the United Nations and Mr. Diego Cordoviz, the personal representative of the Secretary General, for the political settlement of the Afghan issue in the past few years and the final stage would be discussed in the Geniva Conference to be held on 5th May, 1986, for which I am quite optimistic that the problem of Afghanistan may be settled, in favour of the Afghan Mujahid nation.
