 while withdrawing. The Russians should also be concerned about their future relationship with the Afghan people. Both of these should be imperatives for the Russians to recognise the realities in Afghanistan and try to talk to the Mujahideen directly. So far, however, they have refused to do so.
 Another sign of the Russians' insincerity at the political level is their “delinking" of the Geneva agreement from the formation of an interim government. In January, President Zia made it clear that Pakistan would not sign the Geneva Agreement with the Kabul puppet regime. How, if the Russians sincerely wanted to leave Afghanistan, they should have tried to come to some kind of understanding with Pakistan on the interim government issue. Vorontsov's trip to Islamabad would have provided an opportunity for that. But before Vorontsov began his trip, Gorbachev made his announcement about starting the withdrawal of the troops on May 15, “provided that the Geneva Agreement is signed before March 15. * Vorontsov also insisted upon the signing' of the Geneva Agreement at the end of his trip to Islamabad, and on several other occasions.
 If the Russians are not sincere in their claims to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, what game would they play to fool the world and change the situation in their favor? At least four scenarios could be envisaged:
 1. To raise world expectations to the extent that no one will doubt that the Russians are determined to leave Afghanistan. The process so far has been: (1) Sheverdnadze's setting a date for the completion of Russian troop withdrawal (end of 1988); (2) Pravda's setting a date for starting the withdrawal (May 1,1988); (3) Gorbachev himself coming forth and setting a date for beginning of the withdrawal (May 15) and a term for its completion (ten months), hie even went to the extent to agree that the withdrawal be “front-loaded”; (4) Spreading rumors that the Russians are making preparation for the emergency evacuation of their puppets (what would be the need for "emergency evacuation" if the Russians have ten months to leave?); (5) Spreading rumors that the Russian families are getting ready to leave Afghanistan.
 In the future, we might see: (1) some Russian families really leaving Afghanistan; (2) a decrease in Russian troop operations in Afghanistan (especially after the SSI report); (3) Russian troops moving from the field to their main centers, and (4) even some Russian troops actually withdrawing.
 The purpose of all the above will be to prove beyond any doubt that the Russian troops are leaving Afghanistan. Then comes Geneva and Pakistan’s refusal to sign the agreement with the Kabul puppet regime, Hov, who should be blamed? Of course, it would be very difficult to counter the propaganda that Russia was ready to stop the bloodshed    in Afghanistan, but others did      not   cooperate.
 Gorbachev has already prepared the grounds for this propaganda. In his February 8 speech, he said, "...That, of course, does not mean that no one could now obstruct the settlement, or push the talks backwards. But   we would not like to     think that some    states or
 political figures might want to be held accountable by the Afghan nation and other nations for scuttling a settlement."
 2. But if the   Pakistan  Government is   forced to sign   the Geneva
 Agreement with  the Kabul regime, then    what might happen? In that
 case, the Russians would certainly start withdrawing their troops, and they might even complete it.______________________________________
