 GENEVA PROXIMITY TALKS
 Despite the optimism of Mr. Coniovez no major achievement has been made in Geneva. The most coatroversal issue, the right for self-determiniation, was dropped from the agenda and the Soviets refused to withdrawa their forces in a short period of time It seems that the Soviets do not have any intention to leave unless the survival of the puppet regime (or a puppet regime) is guaranteed. Under these circumstances, we do not see any possibility in the near future for a solution to the Afghan issue through the present format of Geneva proximity talks.
 A GLANCE AT THE FUTURE OF THE WAR
 The Soviets have weapons, soldiers and money In the present form of war that is not enough to win a victory over the Mujahideen.
 The short term strategy of the Soviets seems to be to act from behind a puppet regime ' both in military and political fields The strength and survival of this regime is essential for any major military and political victory It is obvious that the present puppet regime is too small and too weak to become an important factor in the conflict This regime doesn't have the support of any section of the Afghan Nation. The only weapon it has is Soviet money and fire power which are not proper tools to win the loyalty of the Afghan people
 On the other hand mujahideen, though not in a position to force the enemy out, have popular support They are determined to continue and their fighting abilities are improving and their political initiatives are moving in the right direction.
 With these elements one can say that the war will continue and will even escalate People will suffer more and become refugees 1987 will be witness to important military and political confrontations and even the Soviets may try to create problems for Afghans in the neighbouring countries by direct and indirect means.
 The future of the resistance depends on the co-ordination and re-organization of fighting forces inside the country and better co-operation among the parties in the political field It is also important that those who oppose genocide and destruction of all aspects of the life of a nation at the hands of the Soviets should feel their responsibilities They should honestly support Afghans both morally and materially, and put greater pressuure on the Soviets Peace will return to Afghanistan when the Soviets leave and the people of Afghanistan are given the oportunity to decide their future, free from outside influence and the threat of subversion of any kind. Until then the presence of an effective reistance is a must to achieve that aim
                                        RABBANI'S TRIP TO AFRICA
 Prof B Rabbani the leader of Jamiat Islami of Afghanistan left Peshawar for Africa on Dec 4th 1986 He will officially visit the three countries of Senegal, Niger and Gabon He will have meetings with high ranking officials of the three countries. This trip is part of the political activities of the Mujahideen aimed at mobilising world public opinion behind the just cause of Afghans
 This is a significant trip because the three countries belong to the Non-Aligned Movement and the trip will improve the position of the Mujahideen in this organization
 This trip will help the leaders and people of the host countries to have a better knowledge of the situation in Afghanistan This is necessary because the mobilization of public opinion in the Third World countries against the invasion is one of the main political targets of the Reistance
 We believe that such trips by the leaders of the Resistance are necessary and serve a great purpose,
