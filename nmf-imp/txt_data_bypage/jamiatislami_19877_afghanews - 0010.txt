Sher Aghaa young photographer and fighter entered the burning APC and took out 17 Guns and several boxes of ammunition. Every minute there vas the possibility that the APC might explode.
The outcome of the Ambush vas that 20 soldiers and officers vere captured and 17 guns seized. 3 civilians we martyred as a result of the enemy's indiscriminate fire.
Prisoners we released after a short interrogation and the happy nevs reached every body in the valley and all the people in the valley thanked Almighty Allah for the victory over the enemy of their faith.
It is interesting to knov about the fate of the four young heroes vho von the victory:
Commander Vasay vas martyred tvo months later after the event in a face-to-face battle. He vas a real hero and nil be remembered for ever. Payanda Mohammad lived 3 months more and vas martyred tvo meters avay from his enemy positions in a very
close combat.
Sher Agha lived longer and continued to fight, film and photograph He vas martyred in a battle tvo years later. The only survivor is Gul Haider, vho lost one of his legs in a land-mine explosion. He made an artificadl leg and returned to the area. Mujahideen from the area honored him by choosing him as their commander. He is conducting the var against the enemy vith high morals and firm belief in final victory.
Prophet Mohammad (P.B.U.H) said:
Fear Rllah wherever gou are, and follow up a bad deed mith a good one and it mill mipe it out, and behave mell towards people".
                                          UNFAIR REPORTING
    Unlike the Soviets and their puppets. Mujahideen do not put any conditions on the reporters vhom they take into the country and leave them to report vhat they see.
    To dramatize their reports, some reporters attribute some actions to the Mujahideen vhich they have not done One of the reporters of Time Magazine vho visited the liberated areas of Afghanistan recently quoted a Mujahid as saying that the Mujahideen cut the throats of the Soviet prisoners, throv them from cliffs, or stone them to death. .
    Mujahideen are Muslims and fight the var based on the principles of Islam. Islam is forbids the mistreatment of the prisoners Jehad is not a var ■vith no rules as the reporter has put it. In the past Mujahideen have released several Soviet prisoners and are keeping tens of them like guests in the liberated areas. Mujahideen's humanitarian action of POVs have been unilateral and not reciprocated vith the Soviet and their puppets . It is the mistake of the reporter to quote an individual on such an important issue vithout checking the facts vith responsible people.
    These stories are vritten to dramatize the report but it conveys a vrong message and ____damages the credibility of the resistance. _____________________________
