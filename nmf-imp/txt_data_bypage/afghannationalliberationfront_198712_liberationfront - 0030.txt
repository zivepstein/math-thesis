     *----------------------- AFGHANISTAN: -----------------------------
   President Zia-ul-Haq in an interview with Austrian journalist in Islamabad, published in three leading dailies, in Vienna” “It seems that the Soviets are serious in their offer to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, the President said, “But they fear this would result in a massacre of their supporters there”.
   General Zia-ul-Haq said, Soviets pull out from Afghanistan would take place as soon as possible and be coupled with the creation of a caretaker government in Kabul under the control of a U.N. peacekeeping forcq- ' “This caretaker government would have to be headed by a person who has -the confidence of the three main -elements in the
 Afghanistan conflict — the freedom fighters, the refugees and the present government of Kabul.”
   Earlier, addressing an impressive Tribal Jirga (meeting) at Landikotal Khyber Agency, on November 18, the President General Mohammad Zia-uf-Haq, said that the Soviet Union has realised that the people of Afghanistan who are-staunch Muslims ^nd fierce freedom fighters, would not permit the present Communist system to perpetuate itself through the puppet Kabul regime in Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan being strategically important, the Soviet wanted to 1 keep it under control for the same reason, the President of Pakistan said.
 adding that he wanted to reaffirm that the people of Afghanistan in their history had never accepted any alien rule nor any system because they knew the value and importance of freedom, and the importance of Islam.
   The President told his audience that it was nothing less than a miracle of the 15th Century Hijra that a superpower with the support of one and a half lakh troops had not been able to occupy a small country like Afghanistan. It happened because^the people of Afghanistan so valiantly and vigorously were offering the sacrifices of their life and so far 10 lakh of them had laid down their lives for the sake of their freedom, he said.
