                            TO MLTHQSE.FHQ BELIEVi IN FREEDOM
 Afghanistan was invaded in 1979. Since then, the Soviets and their puppets have killed more than 500,009 innocent Afghans (U.N report on violation of Human Rights in Afghanistan), destroyed 75* of ail towns and villages , have driven 5 million (out of 16 million pre-war population ) out of Afghanistan and made more than 2 million internal refugees.
 But still most countries have embassies in Kabul and the puppet regime has embassies in these countries. While 123 countries have voted in the U.N General Assembly against the occupation of Afghanistan still the puppet regime is occupying the Afghanistan seat. Afghanistan is an occupied country and the regime is a puppet regime. Still it represents Afghanistan in the non-aligned movement.
                We think it is an injustice which needs correction. We demand that:
 1. All the countries who believe in freedom and oppose Soviet occupation should close their embassies in Kabul and expel the puppet regime s representatives from their own countries .
 2. All sort of trade relatioships with the puppet should be cut immediately.
 3- The Afghan Resistance should be recognized as the sole representative of the people of Afghanistan and be entitled to occupy the seat of Afghanistan in O.I.C , non-aligned countries movements and all the U.N organizations.
                                     Sincerely Yours
                                     The Oppressed People of AFGHANISTAN.
