 speak to you about my tour. In this meeting, I am going to briefly explain my tour of some European States, and invite your attention to some important problmes concerning the Afghan Mujahideen and Muhajreen. It may be known to you that Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani, the leader of Mahaz-i-Mili and I were invited by Political Committee of the Parliament of West Germany to attend a hearing Conference regarding the Russian atrocities in Afghanistan, where a large number of people from the freedom loving nations and also some members of the West German Parliament were present.
      We were warmly and enthusiastically received by the Government and people of West Germany and the participants of the Conference. A crippled Afghan child and an Afghan Muhajir lady with her burnt body who had become the victimed of the Russians bombardment exhibited the Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan to the Conference. I fully explained the awful position of the Afghan Mujahid nation and the Russian’s aggressive policy against them and also called the attention of the Conference to those thousands of women, children and aged people who have become the victimized of the Russians atrocities. This brutal action of the Russian expansionists, was seriously condemned by all the members of the Conference including the Communist members present in the Conference. A Russian military officer who has defected from the Red Army and is living in Europe also approved my statement, and gave account of several instances of the Russian cruelties in Afghanistan. I had also a meeting with the members of the Political Committee of the German Parliament, and the Parliament later on discussed the Afghan issue for a full day in detail. I also attended two more Conferences in Geneva
