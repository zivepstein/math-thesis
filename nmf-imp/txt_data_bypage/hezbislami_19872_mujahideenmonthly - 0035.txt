men returned to their village and informed the Pul-i-Khumari autho l ity and the Afghan army headquarters about the incident. The news spreaded in the town and people came to the streets, They raised anti-Soviet slogans and asked for the withdrawal of the Russian troops.
The Pul-i-Khumri authority and
the army failed to calm down the people. The rally was still in its full swing when the Russians reached the spot with their tanks and exchanged hot words with the Afghan army officers about the protest rally. When the Russian officer was shouting on the Afghan army officer, an Afghan soldier opened fire on the Russian officer.
The officer* along with four
Russian soldiers, were killed and in retaliation ten Afghan soldiers were killed by the Russians. Later the Russians controlled the situation and warned the crowd to disperse away. Several tanks were also parked in different part of the city. And the Highway was closed for few days both for the civilian and Afghan army transport.
