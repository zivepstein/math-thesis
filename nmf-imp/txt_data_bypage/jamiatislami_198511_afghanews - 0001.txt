        For the Soviets and their allies this question is irritating.
     For the majority of the people even those who oppose the Soviets political way of thinking, the answer is a positive one. But the facts in Afghanistan refute this accepted view.
        In our country there are about 200,000 Soviet citizens (military and non-military personnel) and we watch them in combat and ordinary life. Ve have witnessed the following facts from Soviet citizenss
     -They steal from Afghans and even their own government on a large scale.
     —They desecrate mosques, shrines and religous books.
     -They burn houses, shops and other buildings.
     -They kill cattle for target practice and for fun.
     -They cut limbs from animals to eat without killing them first.
    • -They defecate.on furniture inside the house,
    . -They mix different types of food together to make it unuseable,
     -They kill innocent. civilians and sejB; their bodies on fire.
     -They throw chemicals on the faces of dead bodies to make them unrecognizable.                                              ; .r ..
    *-Tfiey plant-mihes and boby-traps in houses and farms. The main t • victims of these are the children.
     *They cut fruit trees fox’ fuel. They bomb irrigation channels leaving the trees to die’.                                         ' '
     -They take off doors, windows, and beams to use as fire.wood.
    , -Where their soldiers camp, they foul the area Several months after
     they have lefl/ there is still a bad odour.
        The question can be repeated now in a slightly different way.
     Can we call a person who does these things a civilized man 7 »
     The Soviets are claiming that they have built a society based on high moral standardsj but what they are doing in Afghanistan reveals their true nature.
