IN THE NAME OF ALLAH
      The following is the text of the press conference given by , Prof.Rabbani, spokesman for the coalition of Afghan Mujahi-* deen.
 The whole world including the Russians themselves know that the cruel puppet,Communist regime of Kabul, which has no support from the people of Afghanistan, has survived only with the full support of the
 Russian Red Army.
 We can not think of the present regime in Afghanistan as a government but only as ignoble servants of the Soviet Union. Through their pawns the Russians have committed unprecedented'crimes and broken all forms of international laws. They have contravened the principle of non-interference in a neighbouring country.
 By the merciless massacre on one million innocent Afghans; the destruction of at least 95% of the villages and towns} the destruction of economic foundations of the country which was based 90% on agriculture; by kidnapping our innocent children to educate and indoctrinate them in Marxis ideology; and committing countless other crimes, the Russians have revealed the true nature on their made-in-Moscow proletarian dictatorship.
 While Gorbachev is trying to attract the world's attention particularly the West, for his so-called proposal for a settlement in Afghanistan, the Russian forces are engaged massacring our people, conducting heavy bombardments and launching massive ground offensives against the Mujahideen and defenceless civilians, killing thousands of men, women and children.
 While the Russians are trying to confuse the world with their propaganda, I would lik' to clarify some relevant points*
 Mujahideen are now stronger, more experienced and better organized than before. The Russians will never succeed in changing our absolute determination to gain the complete freedom of Afghanistan from their military presence.
