who say "No to aggression" are supporting their just cause - the demand ofthe people of Afghanistan for an Islamic government is a reality which can not be denied.
The end to the conflict, something that Soviets are promising, comes only when this just and natural demand of the people of this country is met through the excercise of the right for self-determination.
Any alternative, other than Islamic regime or half way measures, can not satisfy people and will not end the conflict. Islam is the bedrock of the resistance. Islamic government in a totally free Afghanistan is the first and last political slogan of the resistance.
Afghan resistance sent a delegation to Summit meeting which started on January 26 in Kuwait. The delegation was headed by Prof. Sayyaf the current spokesman of the Alliance.
0.1 C has passed many resolutions in the past asking for the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and restoration of Islamic status of that country, all of which have been ignored by the Soviets. The membership of the puppet regime in the conference is posponed and the resistance has only observer status in that organization.
The Resistance has tried to be accepted as the full member of O.I.C but so far due to the presence of pro-Soviet countries like S.Yemen, Libya. Syria, and P.L.O it has not been successful. The Summit meeting may repeat the past resolutions. To except a more active stand on Afghanistan issue seems un realistic
Iran's absence, new propaganda offensive launched by the Soviets which has provided more ammunition for the pro-Soviet elements in the conference and the big list of the issues on the agenda ail are the factors working against the resistance.
