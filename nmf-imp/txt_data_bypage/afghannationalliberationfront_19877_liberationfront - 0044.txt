    In regard to the future of Afghanistan my stand is clear. My obligations towards the Afghan Mujahid Nation would be fulfilled as soon as The Soviet Forces withdraw from Afghanistan and an i tide pendent, sovereign,
    islamic and nonaligned state was established.
    Then it is up to the people of A fghanistan t(> form a Government of their own choice and select a Qualified Afghan as their leader and head of the state.
