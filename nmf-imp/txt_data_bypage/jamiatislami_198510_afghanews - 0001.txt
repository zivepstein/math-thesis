                      AFGHANS_^M_THANKFUL TO ■ THE BRAVE SWEDISH LADY
    In the youth conference which was convened in Moscow some weeks ago, Katarina Lorsson, a brave Swedish lady, strongly criticized the policy of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan Her speech was welcomed by most of the participants*. The Soviet authorities tried very hard to prevent her speech but they failed. As a last resort they stopped translation of the speech into Russian, This act of the Soviet authorities contradicts all accepted international norms.
    Mujahideen inside the country were highly impressed by the. courage of this brave lady and other delegates who raised their voices against the crimes which the' Soviets are committing against the. innocent people of Afghanistan. For several days the name of Katarina was repeated by Mujahideen and they related the story of her bravery to each other. The name of this lady and others who defended the cause of justice and of peace will be remembered for ever.
    Gorbachev, the first secretary of the Communist party of the Soviet Union , has been invited by Francois Mitterrand, the president of the Republic of France, to pay an official visit to France in the first week of October.
    The people of Afghanistan fully appreciated the efforts of the French government towards the restoration of national soverignty in their country and its position in defending peace and the cause of freedom. The people of Afghanistan also remember that the president, of the Republic of France when he was assuming power as the president emphasized that the normalization of their relationship with the Soviet Union was conditional on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and finding a political solution to this problem.
    Unfortunately the Soviet leadership not only did not respect this just demand of the French government, but it extended the level of their military activities' in Afghanistan. After eight, years of political and six years of military intervention their atrocities against the people of Afghanistan has reached its new hights.
    While the people of Afghanistan are aware of the needs for contacts between the countries and are., not worried about, these types of meetings, we expect the meeting of President Mittorand and Mr. Gorbachev to have a peace initiative that the Soviet intervention will be condemned and practical steps are taken for the restoration of the freedom of the people of Afghanistan.
