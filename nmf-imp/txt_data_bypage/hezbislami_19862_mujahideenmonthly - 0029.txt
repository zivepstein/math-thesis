The government knew that overt training was being imparted to the Marxist novices but did not stop it because they new it would cost them their throne if they protested; thus the Russians were training personnel through when they would realize' the dreams of the Czarist regime to get to the warm water ports of the India Ocean.
The invasion of Afghanistan is part of the game and the Russians long-term policy in South Asia is to conquer Pakistan, Iran and India so as to offest the American presence in the Indian Ocean, to control the jugular veins of the west's oil supply and to encircle
China. Afghanistan is therefore the first step of the lader to this end.
For the realization of their nefarious expansionist designs, the Russians have undertaken the same methodology of brainwashing and indoctrination of people in different countries of this region either taking them to USSR under the pretext of high education or in their own countries to help pave the way for the colonization of their respective countries.
It is very unfortunate to note that serveral Gulf countries which were immune to such intrigues, have now started to get themselves victimized deliberately by establishing diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R. They probably have not taken any lesson from theAfghan traumatized ordeal of having close
relation s with the Russian.
Although the Russians southward drive has been effectively checked by the Mujahideen of Afghanistan in the Hindukush mountains and thus have nipped Czars' strategy in the bud. However, we would like to warn other thired world countries to not repeat the mistakes the Afghan rulers had committed over half a century ago and be aware of the surreptitious Russian penetration in their countries under different pretexts.
The Jihad in Afghanistan has for the first time in centuries proven to have shattered the dreams of the Soviet of getting a foothold in the Indian Ocean.

A SOLDIER’S TESTIMONY
---------------------------------------------------------.
EARLY LAST YEAR, A TAPE CONTAINING AN INTERVIEW WITH A SOVIET SOLDIER WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AFGHANISTAN WAS SMUGGLED TO THE WEST FROM THE SOVIET BALTIC REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA. THE INTERVIEW WAS PUBLISHED IN ISEKIRI, AN ESTONIAN-LANGUAGE SAMISDAT (UNDERGROUND)

WERE THERE AS A RUSSIAN SOLDIER, HOW DID YOU SEE YOUR POSITION?
This is a difficult question. In Afghanistan we were in a desperate situation and we didn t think about such things. I may be wrong, but I now think we are the occupying force. I think about this more and more.
IS THE SOVIET ARMY THE ONLY FORCE? WHAT ABOUT THE REGULAR AFGHAN ARMY?
Those I saw were old men, illiterate semi-idiots. We were together in the so-called "friendly joint-actions". That meant that
HOW OFTEN WERE YOU IN ACTION AGAINST THE AFGHAN GUERR ILLAS?
The situation of our army there was often really terrible and unclear. It was difficult to say who was a partisan fighting against his country's aggressors and who was a bandit torturing our prisoners of war. There were places where we did not dare to go because the Afghan rebels (Mujahideen) occupied strong positions and were well equipped. It is not possible for me to assess the general situation there, but I say that our military operations were very often limited because of the Afghan
partisan's fierce fight against us for their freedom.
YOU CALL THEM "FREEDOM FIGHTERS"?
When I was there,, we never called them that. It would have been dangerous, because we didn't trust each other. We couldn't dare to admit that they were freedom fighters, because then, who were we? But now, back home, I know they are freedom fighters.
