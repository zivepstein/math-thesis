 The report says that Khuaja Zabihullah, Jamiai Commander in Ghooryan welcomed the decision of Abdul Satar and his followers It should be noted that the Soviets are trying hard to form militia groups to decrease the
 burden of war from the shoulders of their soldiers,

Ideology does not play a role. Some militia groups are cooperating with the Resistance and almost ail of them are selling arms and ammunition to the Resistance.
