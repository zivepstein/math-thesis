Women arc allowed to hold property in their own respect and( they could dispose of their property independently. This property includes what they might have acquired through their own labour or acquired through dower, inheritance, by gift, or through any other way that is lawful. A woman can own an estate and the woman may reside in her own estate, if the husband has not got power to provide her a domicile. The husband can as well reside with the wife but the woman still remains the legal owncrof the house. In fact the husband’s consent is only necessary because the husband is the head of the house. The rationale behind this is not that the man will take the possession of her estate but that the male must always be affirmed as the head of the family. The woman is still the mistress of her personal estate.
If a woman is wealthy she can also willingly help her husband from her own wealth.
If she decides not to, the husband can not lake the possession of her property by cohesion on this. Even if it happens that a woman dies while the husband is alive, the spouse can never take the death of such a wife as an advantage to take her belongings. The husband is howeverentitlcd to certain fixed portion of her property after her demise but not to the extent of taking everything. The property of a woman is not also shared along with that of her husband in case the latter' dies first. The Woman retains her right over her own property while only the property of the husband is disbursed to the appropriate channels. The stand of the Holy Qur’an is as follows:
“Q ye who believe you are forbidden to inherit women against their will”9
The Holy Qur’an thus warns that women’s property should not b 6taken over unlawfully. This verse could also be taken to mean that men are forbidden in Islam to marry widows by force or through inheritance. '

I THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN ON MEN 1
This implies the obligatory duties of men to I women. The rights include proper maintenance I when she is healthy or sick by making for her I adequate provision for food, shelter and clothing. I In Islam men are enjoined to treat women with love and kindness. The authority of this is found in the j Holy Qur’an and the Sunnahofthe Holy prophet. It is incumbent upon the men to take care of their wives during the latter’s sickness. A man should be responsible for the cost of the medical care. Although a man may not be held responsible for Everything. The woman could as well help the husband out of her own means. Thus a woman can still remit part of the money expended on her when the woman recovers from her sickness and then resumes work.
Islam also gives women the right to be provided with adequate food, and other things. To butress this the Holy Qur’an declares thus:-
“Men are the protectors of women because Allah hath given some of you more strength than the other and that they support them from their means" 10
In the light of the above verse, it is therefore apparent that women are not obliged to work in order to provide for herself and her family. The burden is incumbent on the husband, however the . woman can co-operate and support the husband, especially if the husband is poor since poverty is not an excuse for a Muslim man or woman to practice celibacy.
The rights which Islam gives women as regards inheritance is also seen as a sort of emancipation for them when we examine some Jahiliyyah systems of inheritance. In these various customs; a woman who bears no issue for a man is | notentitledtohispropertyandalsothemalechildisen of a deceased are regarded to have better rights to inheritance than the female children. Moqe often than not the women are excluded completely from inheritance.
