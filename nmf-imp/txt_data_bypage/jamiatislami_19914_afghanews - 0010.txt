Veterans dispute official death figures
Anders Fange A
I watched a TV program about Afghan veterans and their organiztion in the Soviet Union( on Swedish TV). Some interesting figures were mentioned in an interview with one of the leaders of the veteran organiztion. He said the true figures of the Soviet troops who died in Afghanistan were 32,000. He said he had proof that Soviet soldiers were still in Afghanistan as late as July 1990. The
program also gave the account of the living conditions of Afghanistan veterans. It was said that in Leningrad there were 6,000 veterans who were jobless and supported themselves through criminal activities or selling medals and uniforms to tourists.
(Mr. Fange directed the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan’s Peshawar office from 1984 to 1990, and travelled extensively in Afghanistan as a journalist before that.)
