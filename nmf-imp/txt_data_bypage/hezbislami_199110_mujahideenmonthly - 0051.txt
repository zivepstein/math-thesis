Sayings of the Holy Prophet
(SHU)
1 - Narrated Anas who took part in the battle of Badr and was a Naqib (somebody heading a group of six) on the night of Al-Aqaba pledge: Allah's Prophet (peace be on him) said while a group of his companions were around him, "Swear allegiance to me on:
*	Not to join anything in worship along with Allah.
*	Not to steal;
*	Not to commit adultery;
•t
*	Not to kill your children;
*	Not to accuse an innocent person (to spread such an accusation among people); and
*	Not to be disobedient (when ordered) to do good deed."
2- Narrated Aisha; "Whenever Allah's Prophet ordered the Muslims to do something, he used to order them deeds which were easy for them to do (according to their strength and endurance)". They said "0 Allah's Prophet (peace be on him), we are not like you. Allah has forgiven your past and future sins." So Allah's Prophet (peace be on him) became angry and it was apparent on his face. He said, "I am the most Allah-fearing,and know Allah better than all of you do".
