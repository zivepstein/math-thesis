      But the critical question to be answered before the Afhan Mujahideen and Muhajireen return to their homeland is, who will form the Government, what type of Government and how it will be formed. This question, I have also put before the Leaders of           Organi-
 zations at Peshawar on several occasions. However, so far no concrete action has been taken for answering this question, in my case, I assure the Afghan Mujahideen and Muhajireen, that power is not my objective, my sole aim and objective is, to fight for the liberation' of Afghanistan, and serve the nation after the liberation of the country, not as their leader or head of the state but, as ordinary citizen of Afghanistan. It is for the Mujahid nation of A fghanistan to choose their leader and form the Government of their own choice based on Islamic principles and / would be the first person to follow him sincerely.
      Now my humble request to the leaders of the Mujahid organizations once again is to choose their leader whether it may be through the elections of their own organizations or through the Muhajireen residing in the Refugees Camps or possibly through a Loya Jerga (Great Council) in which the representatives of the- Afghan Muhajireen (Refugees). Mujahideen (freedom fighters) intellectuals and spirituals, from inside Afghanistan, and those who are living in Pakistan, Iran, Europe, America and else where would participate. By this way the formation of Government in exile, before returning to Afghanistan, another possible tug of war for power would be prevented.
      Finally, I express my profound gratitude to the President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Prime
