Who is who in the Mujahideen
Dagarwal Mohammad Naim
Colonel Mohammad Naim and three other officers serving long-term jail sentences were exchanged with four regime personnel on May 31 in a prisoners-exchange deal struck between the Supervisory Council and the Kabul regime.
The four officers were brought to Jabulseraj and were set free after the Mujahideen released regime prisoners.
The Kabul regime imprisoned Col. Naim and other officers of the Intelligence Section of the army in 1985 on charges of collaboration with resistance. After being tortured, he and nineteen other officers were tried and sentenced to long-term imprisonment
He was the deputy head of intelligence section of the regime army when he was imprisoned. He provided Ahmad Shah Masood with vital information about the enemy plans against the Mujahideen.
The Soviets were facing tremendous problems in the Panjshir Valley. They believed that the Mujahideen contact with regime officers was the main source of their problems because they could not hide their plans from the Mujahideen. The Soviets and the Kabul regime intensified their efforts to 'cleanse' the regime army of officers sympathetic to the Mujahideen.
When in 1985 the Mujahideen of Panjshir captured the regime garrison in Pushghoor, Soviets became very angry. They had established the garrison after suffering heavy casualties and then had handed it over to the regime. About 500 of the enemy were captured by the Mujahideen. This incident led to Col. Naim's arrest.
Mohammad Naim said the prisoners suffered a greet deal from malnutrition and poor health conditions. Most of the prisoners suffered physical and mental diseases. Regime officers treated the prisoners very badly and this was a reason for their psychological problems. Until two and a half years ago international organizations were allowed meet the prisoners and see their living conditions. A major source of worry for the prisoners was the fate of thousands of their friends who had disappeared and to whom no one knew what had happened.
In Peshawar, Mohammad Naim was surprised to see that the families of missing Soviet soldiers came to Pakistan to get information about their sons and were helped on humanitarian
grounds, but that there was no activity to get information about thousands of Afghans, captured by the Soviets and the regime, who never returned. They also have families waiting for them, the Colonel said. Mohammad Naim said the only good thing that he remembered from the prison was company of some Islamic scholars. He learned from them a great deal about Islam.
Mohammad Naim was bom 51 years ago in Hasan Khail of Sayyed Abad District, Wardak Province.
After completing primary school in Sayyed Abad, he went to the military high school in Kabul. After graduation from Military University he enrolled in the Engineering Faculty of Kabul University.
He went to the Soviet Union for higher military studies and then to India for the same purpose. In 1983 he returned to Kabul and was assigned to the Army's intelligence Section.
After his release from prison, he spent some time in Panjshir where he underwent a medical checkup and rested for a while. Then he went to Takhar to meet with Commander Masood. Passing through Panjshir, he was astonished by the number of enemy armored vehicles destroyed in the valley. On the way to Takhar he spent one night with a nomad family which greeted him with traditional hospitality. They told him that they used to go to Bamyan and Ghorband in the past, but now they come to Panjshir because the security situation in the area controlled by the SC is very good. After five years in jail, spending one night with a nomad family in a beautiful and free valley was an unforgettably pleasant experience for the Colonel.
During his stay in Taliqan he watched a football match. A large number of people had come to watch the game. The city was free and peaceful and the quality of the game was very good. Happiness could be seen in the faces of the people. It was an impressive scene, which the Colonel still enjoys talking about. He was impressed by the achievements of the SC in the military and administrative fields. What he was impressed by the most, however, was the peace that prevailed in the areas he passed through.
Colonel Mohammad Naim said the enemy feared the unity of the Mujahideen the most. There is no weapon more frightening to the puppet regime than unity.
