Br. Hekmatyar and Br. Rubbani during the meeting when the agreement between two parties was read.

Nowadays the topic under long discussions and hot debates in our migrated society is “elections”. Unfortunately, some of our politicians are questioning the praticability and viability of elections because they are not ready to share power and let the people participate in running their country. These politicians are ignoring the centuries-old legacy of those societies which have struggled for justice and human liberty. They flay at elections and interpret the idea according to their own vested interests.
Some politicians in their eagerness to maintain their positions have said that elections are un-lslamic. Close examination of the Quran and Hadith as followed by the caliphs and succeeding governments in Islamic history reveals otherwise.
The only source of political power in Isldm is the Ummah (Community of Believers). Authority over the Ummah is from the Ummah and for the Ummah. The Holy Prophet of Islam (PBUH) did not appoint a successor for himself, or even a Shura. It was clear that he left the decision to the discretion of the Ummah, and Hazrat Abu-Bakr (MABPWH) was chosen by a gathering of the people to be the first caliph of the Ummah.
The second caliph Hazrat ‘Umar Farooq (MABPWH), in the agony of death and at the insistence of the people, named a seven-member Shura to elect the next caliph. He also ordered, “He who tries to become Amir by coercion rather by the result of consultation with the Muslim Community must be instantly beheaded.”
When there were two candidates with equal votes, Hazrat Abdur-Rahman (MABPWH) was assigned to do some research to find out which candidate had more support from the people. He worked continuously and tirelessly for three days and three nights to ask all the residents, of Madinah, which candidate
they preferred. He even asked the carvans which were arriving from Makkah. Finally, the conclusion was that Hazrat ‘Uthman (MABPWH) was chosen.
Islamic governments continued to follow this pattern of obtaining the opinion of the people to chose a leader. The pattern was established by the Quran and the Hadith.
The Holy Quran says “They conduct their affairs by consultations” and “consult them in affairs”. This indicates that the choice of amir or ruler is to be conducted by way of Shura (Council) or by Mushawara (Consultantion).
To avoid self-centered, overly ambitious, and avaricious leaders, our Prophet (PBUH) ordered, “Never strive for rulership. If you were entrusted with such tasks by the Ummah, you will surely receive the blessings of the Exalted Allah (SWT). But if you personally strive and ask for rulership, Allah (SWT) will abandop you to your own.”
The candidates are to be judged by the people on two criteria: knowledge and taqwa, i.e., commitment to Allah. Only knowledgeable people are to be entrusted with leadership. Our Beloved Prophet (PBUH) said, “When incompetent people are entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims, expect the outburst of the doomsday.”
Mawlana Sayyed Abul-Ala Maududi has siad, “On specializing the sovereignty to the Exalted Allah, SWT, there is unanimity between Islamic government and theocracy. But, in the implementation procedure, it follows a separate way from that of the theocracy. Instead of confining all authority to a .particular class of the religious leaders, the Islamic government recognizes that all faithful members of the society — those who have vowed before Allah (SWT) to obey Him -- deserveand are_worthy of God’s
