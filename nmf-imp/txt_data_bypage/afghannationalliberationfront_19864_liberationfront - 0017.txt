 people of Afghanistan encounter is the indiscriminate bombardment of their homes and villages from ground and air by the ruthless Soviet army. When the freedom fighters (Mujahideen) attack the invaders and when the Russians are inflected a heavy blow, which is always , the case, Red Army units bombard the whole region and destroy everything in that area. They butcher women, children and old people. They even do not have mercy on the animals and cattles. They do this to revenge then-defeat and to. intimidate the rest of the people. Ever since their intervention in Afghanistan, the Soviets have been conducting mass murders of civil populations as a result of their frustration at the battlefield. However, by now Soviets have chosen to conduct massacres as a calculated measure both to specify civilians and to reduce the population. They now use special commando units to kill civilians and massacre entire village populations.
 The highways which often go through fertile cities, villages and woods (for example Kohdaman and L-ogar) the Soviet army has chopped all the trees and has levelled to the ground all the villages and houses in distance of three kilometres all along these highways. They have done this in order to drive the people out of the vicinity of the highway. Their purpose is to safeguard against the gallant attacks
 of the Afghan Mujahideen, who use these villages and towns as their shelters and places of hiding. This policy of the Soviet army has forced the poeple to migrate to big cities and to neighbouring countries. As a result the people are faced with a variety of problems of poverty, homelessness and hunger.
