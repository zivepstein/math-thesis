                                                   %
 The American government has decided to sell great quantities of wheat at subsidized prices to the Soviet Union. The American government calls the
 deal aid to the American farmers.
 The Soviets are using some of the wheat they buy from America to feed their soldiers m Afghanistan and to provide the puppet regime . As with every thing else, food is a political tool in the hands of the Soviets . The American wheat given to the puppet regime by the Soviets will be used to buy off the people whose harvests have been destroyed by their forces.
                                                                                                     I
 President Carter had put an embargo on American wheat sale to the Soviets when the Red Army invaded Afghanistan in 1979 Reagan has lifted the embargo and the Soviets did not pay the price they deserved because oh their invasion. Offering wheat at subsidised prices is a new bonus for the Soviets who are still busy killing Afghans.
                                    JAM I AT CONDEMNS APARTHEID
 Allah created all men and women from the same mother and father so they are equal Men and women should be judged by their deeds, not the colour
 of their skin.
                    Apartheid is the remains of colonialism and is an immoral and inhuman
 system.
We are sympathetic to the millions of black people who suffer from this cruel system. We support the struggle of the majority for equality of races. We do this because Islam has rejected the supermacv of one race over
