Afghans' sacrifices bring historic victory
ON May 15. the Soviets started to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan. The withdrawal was pm of the Geneva agreement which asks the Soviets to take out mere than 120,000 of their troops within nine months.
The withdrawal of Soviet troops is a frig victory for the Afghan people. The Afghans have achieved this victory fry paying a high price.
More than half a minion people tost their lives in eight years of war. Five mill ion became refugees in neighboring countries and two more million were displaced inside the country. The economic life of the country was devastated and 75% of all the villages and towns were destroyed.
The Soviets did not start leaving Afghanistan out of good wili. They were farced to do so by military pressure from within Afghanistan and political pressure from outside,
However the beginning of Soviet troop withdrawal does not mark the end of their hostility towards the Afghan people.
The Geneva agreement provides them with nine more months to fight against the Afghan people. They have also shown a readiness to continue giving substantial military and non-military aid to the puppet regime in Kabul which is facing the opposition of the majority of Afghans
The Soviets have said they will keep military and civilian advisors in Afghanistan to help the puppet regime. The number of these people before the invasion was estimated at 20,080 men.
As the Soviet troops leave their bases they hand over the military installations to the regime. The military equipment they are leaving behind is estimated to be worth a billion US Dollar,
The Soviets have left behind millions of mines in Afghanistan which will continue to kill civilian Afghans in the future. They have neither cleaned the mine fields from the areas they have left nor provided any map of the mine filds to be cleaned by the Mujahideen,
When the puppet forces evacuated some of its positions along the border area, it set baby-traps and laid mines in the villages, mosques and houses. This caused some casualties among the population who returned to their villages after they were liberated.
Why do the Soviets not stop hostilities towards a nation which had never created any problems for them
