Tunisia and Algeria (north Africa)
In Tunisia ‘Harkate Nahzat’ the Islamic movement, has been very successful! in influencing the youth. They went to the extent of toppling the unlslamic regime of Habib Boraqiba in 1988. But the new regime working under an anti-Islam ruler, zainul Abideen Bin Ali, is bent on suppressing the Islamic movement. About 10,000 pro movement workers are imprisoned. 11 Youth of them died in jail. The regime is relentlessly using its radio, television and newspapers to malign the movement. Will it work? Did the rulers succeed in the past?
Algeria is the victim of one-party socialist dictatorship from its independence in 1962. Bin Bila laid the foundation of a wrong system. Hawari Bomedein entrenched the dictatorial system. He did his utmost to destroy the Islamic values for 25 years. As a result the country came to the brink of economic and moral insolvency. At last the great youth of Algeria returned to their origin. They came under the banner of Islamic Salvation Front. In 1989 theFrontgained majority in provincial and local bodies elections. They were preparing to
participate in the general elections that the government, under the pressure from Europe, prepared an electoral mechanism which would deprive the Front of its success. The Front protested over it and the government, making the protest as an excuse, declared emergency and postponed the general elections indefinitely. Now the government and the Front (in reality the people) are pitched against each other. The Front has rejected the emergency and the tension is continuing. The government of Shazli Bin Jadid may take a respite but its death is certain.
