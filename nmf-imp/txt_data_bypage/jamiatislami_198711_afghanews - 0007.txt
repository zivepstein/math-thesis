                                    FREEDOM SCORED ANOTHER VICTORY
 The UN General Assembly passed a resolution by an absolute majority asking for the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia. The resolution was passed with 117 votes in favor while a small number of countries opposed. This incident once more proved that the majority of the world rejects invasion and supports the exercise of the right for self-determination of Nations. Those countries who voted against the resolution mainly belonged to the Soviet Block acting under direction from the Kremlin
 Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 3979 3nd installed a puppet regime The people of Cambodia have waged an armed struggle since then to liberate their country
 The situation in Cambodia has some similarities with the situation in Afghanistan, but there are other points which make the two cases different
 The similarities are the invasion by powerful neighbors establishing puppet regimes and the continuation of ar. armed struggle; but politically the Cambodian Resistance is in a relatively better position than the Afghan Resistance
 The Cambodian Resistance has a coalition government which is recognized by some countries and has membership of the UN Successive attempts by Soviet block countries to challenge the membership of the Cambodian Resistance in the UN failed
 The Afghan Resistance has lacked such a political facade it is not recognized as a liberation movement nor it is a member of the UN
 Despite popular support of ;he Afghan Resistance and control of a vast part of Afghanistan the Resistance politically is w an awkward situation
 ll is interesting to see that -i hen the Soviets speak about peace (!) in Afghanistan, the Vietnamese aiso propose peace plans of their choice for Cambodia
 Although the two countries have been invaded by two different neighbors there is close military and political cooperation between the two invaders, the Soviet Union and Vietnam
                                             NO SHIFT OF BASE
  The Daily Muslim quoting the Afghan Media Resource Center reported in its October 14th issue that Commander Masood has shifted his base from Pan)shir to Badakhshan This is not true The true situation is that Panjshir, despite the presence of 7 enemy garrisons is stili a strong base for the Mujahideen and fighting has continued there since the invasion..
  What is new is the expansion of the area Commander Masood has organized While Mujahideen continued their fight in Panjshir they have tried to organize areas outside Panjshir Thank God as a result of hard work, a large area has been re organized and several other mountainous valleys turned into strongholds for the Mujahideen
  The creation of new bases is not equal to abandoning the previous base or shifting the previous to a new one This type of interpretation comes from the people who can not differentiate between a conventional fight and the two armies and guerrilla warfare In the later type of warfare the chief comin&ndei does not stay in one area, because of security reasons It is true that Masood has spent most of the last two years in the North doing political and military work but he has not chosen a fixed base to stay in If he had done that ft would have been the end of his activities.
