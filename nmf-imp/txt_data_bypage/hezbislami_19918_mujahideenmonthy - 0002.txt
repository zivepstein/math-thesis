Hezb-i-IsIami Afghanistan

We want to establish an Islamic government in Afghanistan that is independent, non-aligned and Islamically elected. Our Jihad will continue until this goal is a reality.
We insist on election as the only practical way for solving the current Afghan crisis. No other than an elected Islamic government will be able to put an end to the war and establish durable and security in Afghanistan.
The internal and external policy of our government will be based on Qur’an and Sunnah. We will make independent judgements on all international issues and mainta in friendly relations with all states except those that are engaging in activities deterimental to our faith, independence and territorial integrity.
