Mr. Diego Cordovez disapproves the Islamic Unity of Afghan Mujahideen (IUAM), on a baseless ground, we want him respectfully to answer that how many Uzbaks, Turkmans, Qazaks, Qarghizis, Armenians, Azarbaijanis, Ukrainians, Lithuanians etc are there in the Polit Buro and Central Committee of Kremlin.
As the answer is clearly ’’none", we suggest to Mr. Cordovez to exercise his proposals of Broad-based and Loi Jirgah in USSR to see whether they work or not.
The populations of the above depressed and deprived nationalities in USSR is several times more than the Afghans. They also,on principle, deserve the right to speak for theselves.
Would it not be much better for Mr. Cordovez to raise this important matter with Gorbachev to relieve millions of peoples from Russian dictatorship p
