OFFENSIVE AGAINST REFUGEE CAMPS
The Soviets have intensified their terroristic action in the form of air raids on refugee camps in Pakistan.
Feb. 19, 1987. A large car bomb was exploded by the Soviets agents near a school outside Peshawar. 14 people were killed and more than 60 wounded (most of the victims were innocent school children).
Feb. 26, 1987. On the same, day of the Geneva talks, 16 aircraft bombed a small town in North Waziristan killing 40 people and injuring more than 200 others.
Feb. 27,1987. Six Jets coming from occupied Afghanistan bombed areas near Parachinar in Kurm Agency. 50 civilians were martyred and 30 others killed.
March 23. 1987. Terra Mangal (a small town dose to the border) was bombed 86 people were martyred and 128 others injured.
 March 23. 1987. Mauda Khali area of North Waziristan was bombed by four Soviet Jets. 35 people were killed and 22 injured.
 March 23. 1987. Angori village in South Waziristan was bombed. 23 people were martyred and 47 injured.
 The situation along the border is tense and the Soviet planes are overflying the area and continously violate Pakistan air space.
 This all comes after Soviet propaganda that they want to withdraw from Afghanistan.
 The majority of those killed by enemy air raids were Afghan Refugees and the rest Pakistani brothers. The Soviets have intensified their activities for the following reasons:
       1 - To kill more Afghans and their hosts in Pakistan.
       2- To create tension between Refugees and local the population.
       3-  To force Pakistan to soften its position in Geneva talks on Afghanistan which will be resumed in May.
The saddening part of the whole drama is that the Soviets are not being criticized for their barbaric actions against innocent civilians. Even in the official protests, the puppet regime is blamed, not the Soviets. In fact
