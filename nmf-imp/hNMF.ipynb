       "[u\"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Fresh from a much-needed off day after playing a grueling stretch with 30 games in 31 days, the Oakland Athletics jumped on Bronson Arroyo early and kept pushing the Cincinnati pitcher at every chance.\\rJosh Donaldson hit a two-run homer, newly promoted Stephen Vogt hit a sacrifice fly for his first major league RBI, and the A's beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-3 on Tuesday night.\\r''It's always nice to get those big leads,'' Donaldson said. ''It's kind of been one of those things here lately where we get the opportunities and haven't cashed in right away. Tonight, we didn't have a ton of opportunities late in the game but the opportunities we had early in the game we were able to take advantage of and got a lot of good two-out hits.''\\rJosh Reddick had an RBI double, Yoenis Cespedes added a run-scoring single, and Brandon Moss also hit a sacrifice fly as the A's returned from the road to a cleaned-up Coliseum for an eight-game homestand.\\rThere was fresh carpeting and other upgrades nine days after a sewage problem and flooding in the clubhouses and umpire room that sent the A's and Mariners scrambling for the locker room of the NFL's Oakland Raiders.\\rPat Neshek (2-1) pitched one inning for the win, his 14th scoreless appearance in his last 15.\\rJoey Votto hit his 14th homer, and Cincinnati's Derrick Robinson had a career-high four hits.\\rOakland knocked out Arroyo (6-6) after a season-low four innings - his shortest start since three innings last July 16 against Arizona at home. The A's won for only the fourth time in 11 games.\\rArroyo surrendered seven runs for the first time since allowing eight against the Indians on July 1, 2011, in Cincinnati. He gave up seven hits.\\rVotto homered leading off the fourth but the Reds missed too many other chances to back Arroyo. Cincinnati left 11 men on base.\\rThe Reds hit three straight deep flyballs to center in the first - each of which might have cleared the fences in Great American Ball Park.\\rA's starter Tommy Milone had his winless stretch reach four starts since a win at Milwaukee on June 3.\\rThe lefty walked the final three batters he faced, including Jay Bruce's bases-loaded free pass. Manager Bob Melvin then turned to Neshek, who struck out Chris Heisey to end the fifth.\\rWhile Melvin called it ''difficult'' removing Milone when he was so close to the five innings he needed for a win, the pitcher knew he was laboring.\\r''You could see it,'' Milone said. ''I walked three guys in a row and walked a guy in. I don't blame him for taking me out right there. It makes it easier when you've got the bullpen we do.''\\rThe Reds left the bases loaded in the fifth and again an inning later when Votto flied out to end the sixth, then wasted chances again in the eighth.\\rArroyo lost for only the second time in five June starts, having his two-start winning streak end.\\rHe had beaten the A's in his last three decisions over five starts since losing his first career appearance against Oakland 15-2 on May 27, 2004. Arroyo also had gone at least six innings with two or fewer earned runs in four straight starts - but missed doing so in five in a row for the first time since Aug. 24 to Sept. 14, 2009.\\r''I wasn't surprised they swung early. I was surprised at some of the pitches they swung early on,'' Arroyo said. ''They flipped the tables on me. I usually pitch off the beaten path and they came at me with an approach that was a bit awkward.''\\rReds manager Dusty Baker, the former Giants manager who departed after his club fell just short in the 2002 World Series to the wild-card Angels, got back to his Sacramento-area home Monday and brought freshly picked fruit to the clubhouse. He planned to sleep at his other home in San Bruno on Tuesday night.\\rHe will be ready for a fresh start Wednesday afternoon.\\r''Tough game today,'' Baker said. ''We out-hit them and we left a lot of men on base.''\\rVogt, who is from Visalia and was acquired in an April 5 trade from Tampa Bay, hit a sacrifice fly in the second for his first career RBI as the A's took a 2-0 lead against Arroyo.\\rThe A's called up the catcher from Triple-A Sacramento and he started and batted eighth. His parents, grandparents, wife and toddler daughter were set to be in the stands for his Oakland debut.\\rHe is still searching for his first major league hit, going 0 for 3 to drop to 0 for 28 overall. Vogt was 0 for 25 with two walks in 18 games last season. Since 1990, the only longer hitless streak to open a career was 33 at-bats by Chris Carter with the A's in 2010.\\rThe Reds placed second baseman Brandon Phillips on the paternity list, and he will miss the team's two-game series in Oakland before rejoining the club Friday at Texas.\\rNotes: Oakland goes to Cincinnati for two games Aug. 6-7. ... The Reds reinstated OF Heisey from the 15-day disabled list after a six-game rehab assignment with Triple-A Louisville. He had been on the DL since April 29 with an injured right hamstring. ...

       " u\"CINCINNATI (AP) -- For the first time, the Brewers learned what it's like to keep an opponent from crossing home plate. Pretty nice feeling, actually.\\rJuan Francisco drove in three runs with a sacrifice fly and homer in a ballpark where he's had some big moments, and Yovani Gallardo pitched six innings on Saturday, leading Milwaukee to a 6-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.\\rIt was the Brewers' first shutout - they were the only team in the majors without one. Milwaukee's staff came into the game with the NL's worst earned run average, giving up more runs and homers than any other club.\\r''They've gotten us pretty good in this park this year,'' manager Ron Roenicke said. ''6-0 - we don't have too many of those. It's nice to kind of be able to relax.''\\rThe Brewers have lost 11 of their last 14 games at Great American Ball Park. It was the first time they'd shut out Cincinnati since 2009.\\rLogan Schafer had three hits off Homer Bailey (4-5), his second straight three-hit game. Schafer is filling in for Ryan Braun, who went on the 15-day disabled list with an injured right thumb after the series opener Friday.\\rSchafer has filled in for Braun the last five games and gone 8-for-16 with the first back-to-back multi-hit games of his career.\\r''It's nice to play every day and get that comfort level,'' Schafer said. ''I felt good all day. One thing I've been doing a little better lately is swing at strikes and not going out of the strike zone.''\\rGallardo (6-6) gave up three hits and a pair of walks in his second straight impressive start. The right-hander threw eight shutout innings, allowing only four hits, during a 6-1 win at Miami on Monday.\\r''I feel good - the past three starts, actually,'' Gallardo said. ''It seems like things are finally falling together. I've been able to find a rhythm.''\\rThree relievers completed a seven-hitter for Milwaukee's first shutout. The Reds didn't get a runner to third base and were out of sync after playing extra-inning games the last two days.\\r''None of us looked like we had any rhythm,'' said manager Dusty Baker on his 64th birthday. ''It was one of those low-energy days that usually don't happen. It just wasn't our day.\\r''That's not the way you want to spend your birthday. If I'd known that was going to happen, I would've tried to get kicked out in the first inning.''\\rAfter going 6-22 in May, the injury-depleted Brewers are 8-6 in June, winning six of their last eight games.\\rFor the second time this season, the Reds couldn't overcome a homer by Francisco, who played for them from 2009-11. He hit the second-longest homer in ballpark history during his final season in Cincinnati, a 502-foot shot. He returned with the Braves this season and had a breakthrough - his first career grand slam off reliever J.J. Hoover during a 7-2 win on May 8.\\rThe Brewers got him for a minor league pitcher on June 3, and he'd struggled until getting back to Cincinnati. Francisco was in an 0-for-15 slump when he had a pinch-hit single in Cincinnati's 4-3, 10-inning win on Friday night.\\rHe hit a sacrifice fly and two-run homer that smacked off the bottom of the left-field foul pole on Saturday, giving the Brewers a 4-0 lead. It was only his third hit in 25 at-bats as a Brewer. With that, Francisco has one of the longest and one of the shortest homers at Great American.\\r''He's got big power everywhere and it was nice for him to get that,'' Roenicke said.\\rBailey gave up eight hits in seven innings and threw a wild pitch that let in a run, leaving him 1-6 career against Milwaukee.\\rSchafer, taking over in left field for Braun, had three hits for the second straight game. His two-run double in the sixth made it 6-0.\\rNOTES: The Brewers called up OF Caleb Gindl from Triple-A Nashville to replace Braun. He pinch-hit and struck out. Gindl is the sixth Brewer to make his big league debut this season. ... The Reds put RH reliever Jonathan Broxton on the 15-day DL, a day after swelling was detected in his right elbow. RH Pedro Villarreal was called up. ... Gallardo picked Joey Votto off first base in the first inning. ... The Brewers expect LH Chris Narveson, on the DL with a sprained finger, to return next week. ... The Reds plan to activate RH Johnny Cueto off the 15-day DL to start the series finale on Sunday against Milwaukee's Wily Peralta.\",\n",
       " u\"PHOENIX (AP) -- Mat Latos started a new winning streak in grand style.\\rThe Cincinnati right-hander went 21 starts without a loss before Pittsburgh beat him on Tuesday. His next time out, he matched his career high with 13 strikeouts Sunday in a 4-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.\\r''When he's good, he's real good,'' Reds manager Dusty Baker said.\\rShin-Soo Choo hit a leadoff home run and Brandon Phillips added a two-run shot in the first inning off Randall Delgado (0-1) as the Reds averted a three-game sweep.\\rThat was plenty of offense for Latos (7-1), who allowed a run on six hits with one walk in 7 2-3 innings.\\r''The first inning it took me a little while to I guess get into a groove,'' he said. ''The first inning I didn't feel too good, didn't feel too great with my command. Then I came out in the second inning and made a little bit of an adjustment, and it worked.''\\rLatos didn't strike anyone out in the first two innings, then fanned 13 over the next 5 2-3.\\r''Not too many guys score against this guy,'' Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. ''Look what he has done over the last 20 starts. We hung in there. We gave ourselves a chance to win. We hung in there enough to get him out of the game. You are not going to win them all.''\\rAfter blowing a save in Cincinnati's 4-3 loss on Saturday, Aroldis Chapman gave up a run in a shaky ninth but still got his 19th save.\\rThe loss snapped Arizona's four-game winning streak.\\rIn the ninth, Chapman got the first two batters to bounce out to shortstop before Cliff Pennington singled and went to second on defensive indifference. Pinch-hitter Wil Nieves singled in Pennington to cut it to 4-2.\\rA wild pitch moved Nieves to second, then Chapman hit Gerardo Parra in the right forearm with a 100 mph fastball.\\rPitching coach Bryan Price went to the mound to settle down Chapman, and the left-hander got Willie Bloomquist to pop out to center to end the game.\\rLatos fanned six in a row in the third and fourth - Delgado, Parra, Bloomquist, Paul Goldschmidt, Miguel Montero and Jason Kubel - all swinging. Of Latos' season-high 110 pitches, 79 were strikes.\\r''Can't complain with that,'' Latos said.\\rThe big strikeout number was a mixed blessing, he said.\\r''You start striking out a lot of players, you start throwing a lot of pitches,'' Latos said. ''Maybe it would have been great to go all nine and not strike out 13, but I'll take it. It was a good win.''\\rHe said his slider ''felt good coming out of my hand.''\\r''That and the changeup,'' he said. ''The changeup is a pitch I've been working on all season.''\\rThe Reds jumped on Delgado from the start.\\rChoo hit an 0-2 pitch into the swimming pool area in right field, his fourth leadoff homer of the season and ninth of his career. Zach Cozart followed with a double, then after Joey Votto struck out looking, Phillips' homer to left made it 3-0.\\rChoo and Phillips each have 11 home runs this season.\\rPhillips had been hitting .164 since missing four games after he was hit by a pitch in the left forearm at Pittsburgh on June 1.\\r''It felt good to come through for the team,'' he said. ''I haven't been doing my job lately but you know I'm trying, I'm trying to step my game up. I'm not my normal self. I'm not 100 percent, but the thing is there's no excuses. I'm still in the lineup so I've got to do my job.''\\rCincinnati added an unearned run in the second. Xavier Paul led off with a double, then Pennington bobbled Devin Mesoraco's grounder down the third base line for an error. Latos sacrificed the runners to second and third, and after Choo walked to load the bases, Cozart brought Paul home with a sacrifice fly to the wall in left-center.\\rDelgado went five innings, allowing four runs - three earned - and six hits.\\rThe right-hander, who came to Arizona from Atlanta as part of the Justin Upton trade, made his second start since being called up from Triple-A Reno to bolster a rotation depleted by the 10-game suspension of Ian Kennedy and a shoulder injury to Brandon McCarthy.\\rThe Diamondbacks broke through in the eighth when Parra doubled with one out, then advanced to third on Bloomquist's groundout. Goldschmidt drew a two-out walk and Montero singled Parra home to make it 4-1, maintaining Arizona's status as the only team in the majors not to be shut out this season.\\rLeft-hander Manny Parra relieved Latos and got Jason Kubel to ground out to first to end the inning.\\rNOTES: After the game, Gibson said 2B Aaron Hill, on the DL since April 14 with a broken left hand, would be activated Tuesday. LHP Joe Paterson was optioned to Triple-A Reno to make room. ... Arizona starters do not have a win in their last 16 games. ... Latos struck out at least 10 for the second time this season and seventh in his career. ... The Reds played for the 17th day in a row. They have a day off Monday, then open a two-game series in Oakland with Bronson Arroyo (6-5, 3.13 ERA) on the mound for Cincinnati and Tommy Milone (6-7, 3.98) going for the A's. ... Arizona has Monday off, then opens a three-game series at Washington on Tuesday. Trevor Cahill (3-8, 3.92) pitches for the Diamondbacks against Gio Gonzalez (3-3, 3.34). ... Pennington started at 3B for the first time since 2008.\",\n",
       " u\"PHOENIX (AP) -- Jason Kubel's legs are feeling better and the Arizona Diamondbacks are reaping the benefits.\\rKubel hit a two-run single in the ninth inning to rally the Diamondbacks past Aroldis Chapman and the Cincinnati Reds 4-3 Saturday night for their fourth straight victory.\\r''It's just being comfortable,'' said Kubel, who missed two weeks this season with a strained left quadriceps. ''I'm not searching or cheating on pitches. I finally feel like I have two legs under me and I'm using them now.''\\rKubel's big hit came shortly after Jay Bruce's second home run of the game gave the Reds a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth.\\rPaul Goldschmidt lined a leadoff single in the bottom half that deflected off the glove of first baseman Joey Votto and into right field. Chapman (3-3) then issued consecutive walks to Miguel Montero and Cody Ross. With the infield drawn in, Kubel singled over second base for his third career game-ending hit and first since May 22, 2010.\\r''You hate to lose it like that,'' Reds manager Dusty Baker said. ''Of late, we've lost quite a few of them like that. It seemed like Chapman was overthrowing some today.''\\rBrad Ziegler (4-1) replaced Heath Bell after Bruce's second home run and earned the win.\\rGerardo Parra hit a two-run homer for Arizona.\\rBell, who had converted nine straight saves, came on in the ninth to protect a 2-1 lead. But he walked Brandon Phillips leading off the inning and Bruce followed with his team-leading 18th homer.\\rBell, who has served as the Diamondbacks' closer since J.J. Putz went on the disabled list May 8 with a strained right elbow, has allowed a home run in each of his last five appearances.\\rPutz could return as early as this week.\\r''We might have to put some thought into that,'' Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. ''He's done a pretty good job for us also. Today wasn't his day and I got him out of there pretty quick. I recognized it.''\\rStarting pitchers Mike Leake and Patrick Corbin dueled for eight innings before turning the game over to the bullpens.\\rLeake retired the first 17 batters he faced and scattered four hits over eight innings with a walk and a strikeout for the Reds, who have lost three straight.\\r''It's a tough one to swallow but we will be right back there tomorrow,'' Leake said.\\rCorbin allowed one run and three hits over eight innings and was handed his fourth straight no-decision in his quest to become the first Diamondbacks pitcher to win his first 10 decisions.\\r''Obviously, I'd love to get that 10th one and get it out of the way,'' Corbin said. ''Fortunately, we came back and won the game.''\\rBruce gave the Reds a 1-0 lead when he led off the second inning with a line drive to the balcony overhanging center field, about 20 feet from where his ninth-inning shot landed.\\rThe 472-foot drive was the longest home run at Chase Field this season and the fourth-longest ever by an opponent. Bruce has homered in seven of his last nine games.\\r''The big night offensively didn't really mean a whole lot,'' Bruce said.\\rCorbin broke up Leake's nascent bid for a perfect game when he looped an opposite-field double into the left-field corner with two outs in the sixth.\\r''It was a terrible swing,'' Corbin said.\\rTwo pitches later, Parra drove a cut fastball just over the fence into the pool area in right-center for his second home run in two games to give Arizona a 2-1 lead.\\rCorbin allowed Bruce's first home run, a single by Devin Mesoraco in the seventh and Derrick Robinson's one-out triple to center in the eighth.\\rWith Robinson representing the potential tying run, the 23-year-old lefty struck out Shin-Soo Choo and Votto to escape the jam and turn the game over to the bullpen.\\r''I was coming inside early and he worked the count full like he always does,'' Corbin said. ''He's a tough batter to face. If he's going to beat me, I was going to throw it as hard as I could by him and if he got me, he got me.''\\rNOTES: Chapman's blown save was his first since May 19 at Philadelphia. ... Arizona has six walk-off wins. ... Gibson tied Buck Showalter for third place on the franchise's victory list with his 250th. ... Bruce had his 13th career multihomer game and first this season. ... Two of Corbin's four hits this season have been doubles. ... Corbin's three walks were his most since issuing five free passes against Atlanta on May 14. ... Leake threw only 52 pitches over the first five innings and 92 total. ... Parra's home run was the second allowed by Leake in his past five starts. ... RHP Randall Delgado will make his second start for the Diamondbacks against RHP Mat Latos in Sunday's series finale. Latos is coming off his first loss of the season Tuesday against Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"PHOENIX (AP) -- Paul Goldschmidt did it again, and this time he got some help from his teammates.\\rGoldschmidt had his third two-homer game of the year and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Cincinnati Reds 11-5 Friday night in Johnny Cueto's worst outing in three seasons.\\rGoldschmidt drove in three runs to raise his NL-leading RBI total to 65. Gerardo Parra hit a leadoff home run for Arizona and Jason Kubel tied his career high with four hits.\\rKubel doubled in a run and scored twice.\\rArizona had not scored more than four runs in any of its previous six games.\\r''That was a great job tonight up and down the lineup,'' Goldschmidt said. ''We've got the talent to do it, and I think we're going to do it. It's just part of the game. It's up and down sometimes. Sometimes we're going to struggle and sometimes we're going to hit the ball well.''\\rCueto (4-1) went 4 1-3 innings and allowed seven runs, his most since Milwaukee scored eight against him on Sept. 22, 2010. The 11 hits off him matched his career worst.\\r''Things did not go well,'' Cueto said through a translator. ''It is just one outing but a bad outing. I have a lot more outings, so I have to keep my head up and continue.''\\rJay Bruce hit his 150th career home run for the Reds. Joey Votto drove in two runs with a long homer and a double.\\rWill Harris (1-0) got one out in relief of starter Wade Miley to get the victory.\\rGoldschmidt has four home runs in four games and 19 for the year, one fewer than he had last season. He hit a two-run shot off Cueto in the fifth and a solo homer off Curtis Partch in the sixth that traveled an estimated 457 feet, making it the longest of Goldschmidt's career.\\r''He's huge for our team,'' manager Kirk Gibson said. ''I don't think anybody else has over 20-some RBIs, Goldy's in the 60s. He's the nucleus of our team, certainly offensively. He's dependable, takes care of himself properly and he keeps pushing on.''\\rCueto, in his second outing since returning from his second stint on the disabled list this season, lost to Arizona for the first time. He had been 5-0 with a 1.66 ERA in six starts against the Diamondbacks. The seven runs he allowed Friday equaled the total he gave up combined in his six other starts against them.\\rThe Reds, making a cross-country trek after splitting four games against Pittsburgh, had counted on a much longer outing from Cueto.\\r''The timing of it all wasn't good because our bullpen was already beat up when we came in here,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ''We were hoping to get quite a few innings out of Johnny tonight and get our bullpen back right for the next couple of days and the off day.''\\rThings began badly for the Cincinnati ace when Parra pulled Cueto's 2-2 pitch into the right-field seats for his fifth career leadoff home run, all this season.\\rIn the second, Kubel led off with a single, then Didi Gregorius singled with one out to put runners at first and second. Miley struck out, but Parra walked to load the bases. Willie Bloomquist, hitless in his previous 11 at-bats, singled to bring in two runs and Arizona led 3-0.\\rIn the fourth, Bruce hit Miley's 0-1 pitch far into the seats in right field for his 16th home run to cut it to 3-1.\\rThe Reds tied it in the fifth. Cueto beat out a bunt single, his second hit of the year, moved to second when Shin-Soo Choo walked and scored on Votto's double into the left-field corner.\\rChoo scored when Brandon Phillips hit the ball sharply to Gregorius at shortstop. Gregorius couldn't make the play and was charged with an error. Phillips was credited with an RBI, and it was 3-all.\\rEarlier in the fifth, Miley slipped on his follow through, prompting a visit from the trainer. He stayed in the game, for the time being. He threw a whopping 104 pitches in 4 2-3 innings, allowing three runs and five hits with four walks and five strikeouts.\\rBloomquist led off the Arizona fifth with a single, then Goldschmidt hit one to the opposite field over the fence in right to put the Diamondbacks back on top for good, 5-3. Miguel Montero followed with a single, then after Cody Ross struck out, Kubel singled and Cueto's night was finished.\\rMartin Prado's sacrifice fly off reliever J.J. Hoover made it 6-3. Kubel came home on Hoover's wild pitch, and Arizona got four in the sixth off Partch to lead 11-3.\\rVotto's solo home run came against Tony Sipp in the seventh.\\rNOTES: The 11 runs were the second-most allowed by the Reds this season. ... Cueto's outing matched his shortest of the season. ... RHP Zeke Spruill, called up from Triple-A Reno earlier in the day, pitched a scoreless inning of relief in his major league debut. The Diamondbacks designated INF Josh Wilson for assignment. ... On Saturday night, in the series' prime pitching matchup, the Reds send Mike Leake (7-3, 2.64 ERA) to the mound and Arizona goes with Patrick Corbin (9-0, 2.28). Corbin will make his fourth try to go to 10-0 after no-decisions in his last three starts. ... Bruce has homered in six of his last eight games.\",\n",
       " u\"CINCINNATI (AP) -- Pedro Alvarez hasn't changed anything in June, except those RBI numbers. They're way up there, just like the Pirates.\\rAlvarez drove in all of Pittsburgh's runs with a solo homer, bases-loaded double and a single on Thursday for a 5-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds and a split of their high-profile NL Central series.\\rThe Pirates remain a half-game behind second-place Cincinnati after the four-game set, keeping them virtually shoulder-to-shoulder as they chase the torrid St. Louis Cardinals.\\rAfter blowing a one-run lead in the ninth and losing 2-1 in 13 innings on Wednesday night, Pittsburgh salvaged a game behind Alvarez and a bullpen running on fumes.\\r''We needed a big day from a number of people today and Pedro was one of them,'' manager Clint Hurdle said. ''There was no bigger swing than with the bases loaded, left-on-left. Beautiful.''\\rAlvarez had an RBI single and his 16th homer off Homer Bailey, who couldn't follow his no-hitter against Pittsburgh with a win. After Alfredo Simon (5-3) loaded the bases in the seventh, Alvarez doubled off left-hander Tony Cingrani to snap a 2-all tie.\\rThe five RBIs were a season high for a Pirate and one shy of Alvarez's career high. The third baseman has been Pittsburgh's top run producer in June, leading the team with 48 RBIs overall.\\rIt's quite a change. Alvarez .180 in April and .225 in May before finding his form. He has six homers in June, second-most in the NL.\\r''I just think it's repetition and getting the opportunity to go out and try to gain as much experience as I can from every day out there,'' Alvarez said.\\rBryan Morris (4-2) contributed to the go-ahead rally with his first career single.

His first career hit off the Pirates' closer was some breakthrough.\\rBruce ended Grilli's saves streak with a solo homer in the ninth, and Brandon Philips singled with the bases loaded in the 13th inning on Wednesday night, rallying the Cincinnati Reds to a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.\\rTwo outs away from a second straight shutout, the Pirates let it get away.\\rGrilli started the ninth needing one more save to tie a club record. He had converted each of his 25 chances this season, one shy of Joel Hanrahan's 2011 club record to open a season.\\rWith one out, Bruce came up with a daunting personal history - 0 for 7 in his career against Grilli with five strikeouts. He waited on a first-pitch fastball and got it, connecting for his fourth homer in his last six games.\\r''They threw him one fastball too many,'' manager Dusty Baker said.\\rIt was the first homer Grilli had allowed this season. Cincinnati hadn't scored in its last 17 innings since Bruce hit a solo homer during a 4-1 win on Monday night.\\r''I've had pretty good success against him,'' Grilli said. ''You feel horrible because the bullpen has been working a lot and we had to go extras and work harder. You lose a tough ballgame in an important series.''\\rManny Parra (1-1) pitched the 13th, and the Reds won it against Vin Mazzaro (3-2). Derrick Robinson and Shin-Soo Choo singled with one out, and Joey Votto was walked intentionally. Phillips singled up the middle to end it.\\r''That's what Brandon does,'' Bruce said.

       " u\"CINCINNATI (AP) -- Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle figured the odds were against Mat Latos extending his impressive streak without a defeat.\\r''He's due to lose,'' Hurdle said pregame.\\rWith one good inning, the Pirates pulled it off.\\rPedro Alvarez singled home a pair of runs in the first inning, and the Pirates ended Latos' streak of 21 regular-season starts without a loss, beating the Cincinnati Reds 4-0 on Tuesday night.\\rLatos (6-1) hadn't lost a regular-season game since last August, setting a club-record streak of avoiding defeat. He couldn't overcome Pittsburgh's three-run first inning set up by his uncharacteristic control problems.\\r''I was aggravated with myself,'' Latos said. ''I didn't throw too well in the bullpen and kind of took it into the first. I beat myself today. It's always hard when you put your team in a 3-0 hole.''\\rLatos had nine of Cincinnati's 17 strikeouts, which matched the club's nine-inning record. The Reds also had 17 strikeouts on opening day, but that came in a 13-inning loss against the Los Angeles Angels.\\rCharlie Morton (1-1) was better during his second start since returning from elbow surgery. He gave up three singles and threw 61 pitches in 5 1-3 innings, starting the Pirates toward their NL-leading 12th shutout.\\r''Fortunately the few times they hit it really hard, they hit it at people,'' Morton said.\\rCincinnati's lineup managed four hits while getting shut out for the second time in their last four games.\\rThe Ohio River rivals have split the first two games of their four-game series, leaving the Reds a half-game ahead of the Pirates. They've been right behind the NL Central-leading Cardinals most of the season.\\rThere was an undercurrent from Monday's game, when Reds closer Aroldis Chapman threw an up-and-in fastball that leveled Neil Walker. The Pirates weren't happy about the pitch's location.\\rMorton's first pitch plunked Shin-Soo Choo on the leg. Morton also threw one inside to Joey Votto, who refused to budge from the box. Votto flied out, and that was the end of the drama.\\rHurdle encourages his staff to pitch inside, part of what he thinks pitchers need to do in order to control the strike zone. Pittsburgh has hit 39 batters, the most in the majors, but also leads in shutouts.\\r''When two teams are focused on winning and neither one wants to blink and they just want to play hard and compete, you push the envelope in a lot of different places,'' Hurdle said. ''Not just at the plate trying to get balls in on people, but breaking up double plays and everything.\\r''So we've got to beat these guys and we've got to beat the Cardinals to get to where we want to go.''\\rLatos yelled from the dugout after Choo got hit. Latos hit Walker in the first inning in Pittsburgh last Saturday, prompting plate umpire Bob Davidson to warn both teams.\\r''It's time somebody stepped up and did something about the team that's hit more guys in the league than anybody,'' Latos said. ''I got fined for hitting Neil Walker, but you've got a team drilling guys over and over again. It's time for the league to step up and end it. That fired me up.''\\rLatos hadn't lost since Aug. 24, when the Cardinals beat the Reds 8-5. In the last 21 starts, he'd gone 10-0 with a 2.80 ERA. The Reds were 17-4 during that streak. Also, Latos had never lost to the Pirates, going 4-0 in eight starts with a 2.29 ERA.\\rFinally, they caught him in a slow start.\\rHe struggled with his control at the outset, needing 32 pitches to get through a 19-minute first inning. Starling Marte tripled and scored on Russell Martin's infield single, giving Pittsburgh a run after only four pitches. Latos walked Garrett Jones and Walker, and Alvarez singled for two more runs.\\rLatos settled down after the first, fanning eight of the next 11 batters. The problem was his pitch count, which was at 88 when he left for a pinch hitter with two runners aboard in the fifth inning. His streak was left in the hands of the bullpen and the offense.\\rThey couldn't bail him out. Marte singled home another run in the seventh.\\rMorton had a lot to do with it, too.\\rThe right-hander dominated the Reds in 2011, giving up only one run in two complete games at Great American Ball Park. He had his right elbow rebuilt last June 14 and returned to the majors last Thursday, allowing four runs and seven hits in five innings of a 10-0 loss to San Francisco.\\rHe was much better this time, an encouraging sign for a Pirates rotation hit hard by injuries. Tony Watson, Mark Melancon and Jason Grilli finished it.\\rNOTES: The Pirates agreed to terms on Tuesday with C Reese McGuire, their first-round pick and the 14th overall selection in this month's draft. ... Pirates LHP Wandy Rodriguez, on the 15-day DL retroactive to June 6 with a tight left forearm, will throw all of his pitches in a bullpen session on Thursday.

The win also kept Cincinnati in second place in the NL Central, a game and a half ahead of the Pirates.\\rCozart connected on a hanging slider in the fourth and Frazier hit a down-the-middle fastball in the sixth off Liriano (5-3), who hadn't allowed a homer in his seven previous starts. He opened the season on the disabled list, recovering from a broken right arm last December.\\rDuring a game in Pittsburgh this season, Liriano tied up Frazier with a fastball. He had that in mind when he came to bat and got one on the first pitch.\\r''That one felt pretty good,'' Frazier said. ''He tried to get one past in Pittsburgh and I got enough of it to get a single. I was looking for it, and got my (front) foot down sooner and got some good wood on it.''\\rJoey Votto and Jay Bruce connected in the eighth inning off Bryan Morris. Bruce has three homers during a five-game hitting streak.\\rMike Leake (7-3) extended the best stretch of his four-year career, giving up six hits - including Russell Martin's RBI double - in seven innings. Leake got 13 outs off ground balls and fanned three.\\r''He's pitching with confidence and pitching a little harder,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ''He just goes about his business with no fanfare. There's no difference in his personality.''\\rThe right-hander is 5-1 in his last seven starts with a 1.15 earned run average, showing why the Reds made him their first-round pick in the June 2009 draft.\\r''He's been doing this for three months now and building up to this,'' Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. ''That's a guy that can pitch. That's what he's evolved into. He pitched as well as I've ever seen him.''\\rWith seven wins, Leake is only five shy of his career high from the 2011 season. He went right to the majors after the Reds drafted him out of Arizona State, going 8-4 as a rookie.\\r''I'm a little bit more motivated,'' Leake said. ''I think my head's back in college, pitching-wise, and I'm thinking a little better.''\\rTony Cingrani made his first relief appearance this season and pitched out of a two-on threat in the eighth, fanning Pedro Alvarez to keep the score 2-1. Cingrani joined the rotation when Johnny Cueto went on the disabled list, and the Reds kept him around with Cueto back so they'd have another left-hander in their depleted bullpen.\\rAroldis Chapman pitched the ninth for his 18th save in 20 chances, walking one and fanning two.\\rThe Ohio River rivals have occupied the second and third spots in the NL Central most of the season, staying right behind the torrid Cardinals.

He allowed five hits and one run with three strikeouts and no walks as the Reds took two of three in the weekend series.\\rCueto also eased the fears of manager Dusty Baker.\\r''We only had one worry with Johnny Cueto - was his (shoulder) OK,'' Baker said. ''Other than that, we don't worry about Johnny Cueto.''\\rCueto made his first start since a 6-0 win at Pittsburgh on May 31. He was placed on the disabled list on June 5 for the second time this season because of a strained muscle in his right shoulder.\\rAlfredo Simon allowed two hits and had six strikeouts in three innings of relief for his first save of the season and second in two years with Cincinnati.\\rSimon, who struck out all six batters he faced in a two-inning effort against Atlanta on May 6, struck out the last five batters he faced on Sunday.\\r''My breaking ball and two-seamer were working really good,'' Simon said. ''It was good to give our bullpen a rest.''\\rMilwaukee starter Wily Peralta gave up all five Reds runs - four earned - in 5 1-3 innings. The slumping Peralta (4-8) fell to 1-6 in his last seven starts.\\rCarlos Gomez hit the first pitch he saw - and Cueto's seventh pitch - into the left-field seats for his 12th homer of the season to give Milwaukee a 1-0 lead.\\r''In the first inning, I had too many thoughts,'' Cueto said through an interpreter. ''I was thinking too much. Finally, it was over. When I got to the dugout, Cesar Izturis said, 'Just do what you normally do. If it breaks again, we'll fix it.'''\\r''Johnny hung a slider to Gomez,'' Baker said. ''That was the only mistake he made.''\\rThe Reds tied it with an unearned run without benefit of a hit in the second. Xavier Paul led off with a walk, and Jack Hannahan followed with a chopper to second baseman Rickie Weeks, whose throw bounced past first baseman Juan Francisco for an error.\\rHannahan was forced out, and Paul moved to third on Ryan Hanigan's grounder. Cueto drove in Paul, who broke for the plate on the pitch, with a suicide-squeeze bunt he said he didn't see.\\r''I thought it was going to hit me,'' Cueto said. ''I closed my eyes.''\\rBaker had no hesitation about flashing that signal.\\r''We have confidence in Johnny in almost everything,'' he said. ''That was a situation where it was threatening to rain, and we wanted to get the lead before it rained.''\\rCozart led off the third with a double into the left-field corner, went to third on Votto's groundout, and scored the go-ahead run on Brandon Phillips's checked-swing chopper back to Peralta, who dropped the ball and had to scramble and settle for the out at first.\\rThe Brewers couldn't afford such mistakes with the way Cueto was pitching, manager Ron Roenicke said.\\r''Defensively, we didn't play well,'' Roenicke said. ''Offensively, we didn't have a lot of opportunities.''\\rBruce followed with his 12th homer, a 469-foot drive, that landed two-thirds of the way up the right-field seats. He was more impressed with Cueto's performance.\\r''That was very good,'' he said. ''I think everybody at this point was holding their breath and hoping he could come out of the game feeling good,'' Bruce said. ''It looks like he did. I'm glad today went well.''\\rThe Reds added two runs with one out in the sixth on Hannahan's walk, Hanigan's double off the left-field wall, and Lutz's pinch-hit single up the middle against Mike Gonzalez.\\rNOTES: The Reds optioned RHP Pedro Villareal to Triple-A Louisville to make room on the roster for Cueto. ...

       " u'Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing truth from error, which is properly what is called good sense or reason, is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.\\r\\rFor myself, I have never fancied my mind to be in any respect more perfect than those of the generality; on the contrary, I have often wished that I were equal to some others in promptitude of thought, or in clearness and distinctness of imagination, or in fullness and readiness of memory. And besides these, I know of no other qualities that contribute to the perfection of the mind; for as to the reason or sense, inasmuch as it is that alone which constitutes us men, and distinguishes us from the brutes, I am disposed to believe that it is to be found complete in each individual; and on this point to adopt the common opinion of philosophers, who say that the difference of greater and less holds only among the accidents, and not among the forms or natures of individuals of the same species.\\r\\rI will not hesitate, however, to avow my belief that it has been my singular good fortune to have very early in life fallen in with certain tracks which have conducted me to considerations and maxims, of which I have formed a method that gives me the means, as I think, of gradually augmenting my knowledge, and of raising it by little and little to the highest point which the mediocrity of my talents and the brief duration of my life will permit me to reach. For I have already reaped from it such fruits that, although I have been accustomed to think lowly enough of myself, and although when I look with the eye of a philosopher at the varied courses and pursuits of mankind at large, I find scarcely one which does not appear in vain and useless, I nevertheless derive the highest satisfaction from the progress I conceive myself to have already made in the search after truth, and cannot help entertaining such expectations of the future as to believe that if, among the occupations of men as men, there is any one really excellent and important, it is that which I have chosen.\\r\\rAfter all, it is possible I may be mistaken; and it is but a little copper and glass, perhaps, that I take for gold and diamonds. I know how very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves, and also how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when given in our favor. But I shall endeavor in this discourse to describe the paths I have followed, and to delineate my life as in a picture, in order that each one may also be able to judge of them for himself, and that in the general opinion entertained of them, as gathered from current report, I myself may have a new help towards instruction to be added to those I have been in the habit of employing.',\n",
       " u'I am in doubt as to the propriety of making my first meditations in the place above mentioned matter of discourse; for these are so metaphysical, and so uncommon, as not, perhaps, to be acceptable to every one. And yet, that it may be determined whether the foundations that I have laid are sufficiently secure, I find myself in a measure constrained to advert to them. I had long before remarked that, in relation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above doubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been already said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the search after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was called for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions in regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order to ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that was wholly indubitable. Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes deceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really such as they presented to us; and because some men err in reasoning, and fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry, I, convinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false all the reasonings I had hitherto taken for demonstrations; and finally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations) which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed that all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind when awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams. But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I think, therefore I am [\"je pense, donc je suis\"], was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search\\r\\rIn the next place, I attentively examined what I was and as I observed that I could suppose that I had no body, and that there was no world nor any place in which I might be; but that I could not therefore suppose that I was not; and that, on the contrary, from the very circumstance that I thought to doubt of the truth of other things, it most clearly and certainly followed that I was; while, on the other hand, if I had only ceased to think, although all the other objects which I had ever imagined had been in reality existent, I would have had no reason to believe that I existed; I thence concluded that I was a substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking, and which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on any material thing; so that \" I,\" that is to say, the mind by which I am what I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is even more easily known than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not, it would still continue to be all that it is.\\r\\rAfter this I inquired in general into what is essential I to the truth and certainty of a proposition; for since I had discovered one which I knew to be true, I thought that I must likewise be able to discover the ground of this certitude. And as I observed that in the words I think, therefore I am, there is nothing at all which gives me assurance of their truth beyond this, that I see very clearly that in order to think it is necessary to exist, I concluded that I might take, as a general rule, the principle, that all the things which we very clearly and distinctly conceive are true, only observing, however, that there is some difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we distinctly conceive.\\r',\n",
       " u'In the next place, from reflecting on the circumstance that I doubted, and that consequently my being was not wholly perfect (for I clearly saw that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt), I was led to inquire whence I had learned to think of something more perfect than myself; and I clearly recognized that I must hold this notion from some nature which in reality was more perfect. As for the thoughts of many other objects external to me, as of the sky, the earth, light, heat, and a thousand more, I was less at a loss to know whence these came; for since I remarked in them nothing which seemed to render them superior to myself, I could believe that, if these were true, they were dependencies on my own nature, in so far as it possessed a certain perfection, and, if they were false, that I held them from nothing, that is to say, that they were in me because of a certain imperfection of my nature. But this could not be the case with-the idea of a nature more perfect than myself; for to receive it from nothing was a thing manifestly impossible; and, because it is not less repugnant that the more perfect should be an effect of, and dependence on the less perfect, than that something should proceed from nothing, it was equally impossible that I could hold it from myself: accordingly, it but remained that it had been placed in me by a nature which was in reality more perfect than mine, and which even possessed within itself all the perfections of which I could form any idea; that is to say, in a single word, which was God. And to this I added that, since I knew some perfections which I did not possess, I was not the only being in existence (I will here, with your permission, freely use the terms of the schools); but, on the contrary, that there was of necessity some other more perfect Being upon whom I was dependent, and from whom I had received all that I possessed; for if I had existed alone, and independently of every other being, so as to have had from myself all the perfection, however little, which I actually possessed, I should have been able, for the same reason, to have had from myself the whole remainder of perfection, of the want of which I was conscious, and thus could of myself have become infinite, eternal, immutable, omniscient, all-powerful, and, in fine, have possessed all the perfections which I could recognize in God. For in order to know the nature of God (whose existence has been established by the preceding reasonings), as far as my own nature permitted, I had only to consider in reference to all the properties of which I found in my mind some idea, whether their possession was a mark of perfection; and I was assured that no one which indicated any imperfection was in him, and that none of the rest was awanting. Thus I perceived that doubt, inconstancy, sadness, and such like, could not be found in God, since I myself would have been happy to be free from them. Besides, I had ideas of many sensible and corporeal things; for although I might suppose that I was dreaming, and that all which I saw or imagined was false, I could not, nevertheless, deny that the ideas were in reality in my thoughts. But, because I had already very clearly recognized in myself that the intelligent nature is distinct from the corporeal, and as I observed that all composition is an evidence of dependency, and that a state of dependency is manifestly a state of imperfection, I therefore determined that it could not be a perfection in God to be compounded of these two natures and that consequently he was not so compounded; but that if there were any bodies in the world, or even any intelligences, or other natures that were not wholly perfect, their existence depended on his power in such a way that they could not subsist without him for a single moment.\\r\\rI was disposed straightway to search for other truths and when I had represented to myself the object of the geometers, which I conceived to be a continuous body or a space indefinitely extended in length, breadth, and height or depth, divisible into divers parts which admit of different figures and sizes, and of being moved or transposed in all manner of ways (for all this the geometers suppose to be in the object they contemplate), I went over some of their simplest demonstrations. And, in the first place, I observed, that the great certitude which by common consent is accorded to these demonstrations, is founded solely upon this, that they are clearly conceived in accordance with the rules I have already laid down In the next place, I perceived that there was nothing at all in these demonstrations which could assure me of the existence of their object: thus, for example, supposing a triangle to be given, I distinctly perceived that its three angles were necessarily equal to two right angles, but I did not on that account perceive anything which could assure me that any triangle existed: while, on the contrary, recurring to the examination of the idea of a Perfect Being, I found that the existence of the Being was comprised in the idea in the same way that the equality of its three angles to two right angles is comprised in the idea of a triangle, or as in the idea of a sphere, the equidistance of all points on its surface from the center, or even still more clearly; and that consequently it is at least as certain that God, who is this Perfect Being, is, or exists, as any demonstration of geometry can be.\\r\\rBut the reason which leads many to persuade them selves that there is a difficulty in knowing this truth, and even also in knowing what their mind really is, is that they never raise their thoughts above sensible objects, and are so accustomed to consider nothing except by way of imagination, which is a mode of thinking limited to material objects, that all that is not imaginable seems to them not intelligible. The truth of this is sufficiently manifest from the single circumstance, that the philosophers of the schools accept as a maxim that there is nothing in the understanding which was not previously in the senses, in which however it is certain that the ideas of God and of the soul have never been; and it appears to me that they who make use of their imagination to comprehend these ideas do exactly the some thing as if, in order to hear sounds or smell odors, they strove to avail themselves of their eyes; unless indeed that there is this difference, that the sense of sight does not afford us an inferior assurance to those of smell or hearing; in place of which, neither our imagination nor our senses can give us assurance of anything unless our understanding intervene.',\n",
       " u'Finally, if there be still persons who are not sufficiently persuaded of the existence of God and of the soul, by the reasons I have adduced, I am desirous that they should know that all the other propositions, of the truth of which they deem themselves perhaps more assured, as that we have a body, and that there exist stars and an earth, and such like, are less certain; for, although we have a moral assurance of these things, which is so strong that there is an appearance of extravagance in doubting of their existence, yet at the same time no one, unless his intellect is impaired, can deny, when the question relates to a metaphysical certitude, that there is sufficient reason to exclude entire assurance, in the observation that when asleep we can in the same way imagine ourselves possessed of another body and that we see other stars and another earth, when there is nothing of the kind. For how do we know that the thoughts which occur in dreaming are false rather than those other which we experience when awake, since the former are often not less vivid and distinct than the latter? And though men of the highest genius study this question as long as they please, I do not believe that they will be able to give any reason which can be sufficient to remove this doubt, unless they presuppose the existence of God. For, in the first place even the principle which I have already taken as a rule, viz., that all the things which we clearly and distinctly conceive are true, is certain only because God is or exists and because he is a Perfect Being, and because all that we possess is derived from him: whence it follows that our ideas or notions, which to the extent of their clearness and distinctness are real, and proceed from God, must to that extent be true. Accordingly, whereas we not infrequently have ideas or notions in which some falsity is contained, this can only be the case with such as are to some extent confused and obscure, and in this proceed from nothing (participate of negation), that is, exist in us thus confused because we are not wholly perfect. And it is evident that it is not less repugnant that falsity or imperfection, in so far as it is imperfection, should proceed from God, than that truth or perfection should proceed from nothing. But if we did not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds from a Perfect and Infinite Being, however clear and distinct our ideas might be, we should have no ground on that account for the assurance that they possessed the perfection of being true.\\r\\rBut after the knowledge of God and of the soul has rendered us certain of this rule, we can easily understand that the truth of the thoughts we experience when awake, ought not in the slightest degree to be called in question on account of the illusions of our dreams. For if it happened that an individual, even when asleep, had some very distinct idea, as, for example, if a geometer should discover some new demonstration, the circumstance of his being asleep would not militate against its truth; and as for the most ordinary error of our dreams, which consists in their representing to us various objects in the same way as our external senses, this is not prejudicial, since it leads us very properly to suspect the truth of the ideas of sense; for we are not infrequently deceived in the same manner when awake; as when persons in the jaundice see all objects yellow, or when the stars or bodies at a great distance appear to us much smaller than they are. For, in fine, whether awake or asleep, we ought never to allow ourselves to be persuaded of the truth of anything unless on the evidence of our reason. And it must be noted that I say of our reason, and not of our imagination or of our senses: thus, for example, although we very clearly see the sun, we ought not therefore to determine that it is only of the size which our sense of sight presents; and we may very distinctly imagine the head of a lion joined to the body of a goat, without being therefore shut up to the conclusion that a chimaera exists; for it is not a dictate of reason that what we thus see or imagine is in reality existent; but it plainly tells us that all our ideas or notions contain in them some truth; for otherwise it could not be that God, who is wholly perfect and veracious, should have placed them in us. And because our reasonings are never so clear or so complete during sleep as when we are awake, although sometimes the acts of our imagination are then as lively and distinct, if not more so than in our waking moments, reason further dictates that, since all our thoughts cannot be true because of our partial imperfection, those possessing truth must infallibly be found in the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our dreams.',\n",
       " u'I would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of truths which I deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it would have been necessary now to treat of many questions in dispute among the earned, with whom I do not wish to be embroiled, I believe that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition, and only mention in general what these truths are, that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would conduce to the public advantage. I have ever remained firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which I have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of God and of the soul, and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had formerly appeared; and yet I venture to state that not only have I found means to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy, but I have also observed certain laws established in nature by God in such a manner, and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions, that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these, we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther, by considering the concatenation of these laws, it appears to me that I have discovered many truths more useful and more important than all I had before learned, or even had expected to learn.\\r\\rBut because I have essayed to expound the chief of these discoveries in a treatise which certain considerations prevent me from publishing, I cannot make the results known more conveniently than by here giving a summary of the contents of this treatise. It was my design to comprise in it all that, before I set myself to write it, I thought I knew of the nature of material objects. But like the painters who, finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different faces of a solid body, select one of the chief, on which alone they make the light fall, and throwing the rest into the shade, allow them to appear only in so far as they can be seen while looking at the principal one; so, fearing lest I should not be able to compense in my discourse all that was in my mind, I resolved to expound singly, though at considerable length, my opinions regarding light; then to take the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed stars, since light almost wholly proceeds from them; on the heavens since they transmit it; on the planets, comets, and earth, since they reflect it; and particularly on all the bodies that are upon the earth, since they are either colored, or transparent, or luminous; and finally on man, since he is the spectator of these objects. Further, to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade, and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom, without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned, I resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes, and to speak only of what would happen in a new world, if God were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces matter sufficient to compose one, and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter, so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned, and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature, and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established. On this supposition, I, in the first place, described this matter, and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible, except what has been recently said regarding God and the soul; for I even expressly supposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are so debated in the schools, nor in general anything the knowledge of which is not so natural to our minds that no one can so much as imagine himself ignorant of it. Besides, I have pointed out what are the laws of nature; and, with no other principle upon which to found my reasonings except the infinite perfection of God, I endeavored to demonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt, and to prove that they are such, that even if God had created more worlds, there could have been none in which these laws were not observed. Thereafter, I showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must, in accordance with these laws, dispose and arrange itself in such a way as to present the appearance of heavens; how in the meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets and comets, and others a sun and fixed stars. And, making a digression at this stage on the subject of light, I expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be which is found in the sun and the stars, and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens, and how from the planets and comets it is reflected towards the earth. To this I likewise added much respecting the substance, the situation, the motions, and all the different qualities of these heavens and stars; so that I thought I had said enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in the heavens or stars of our system that must not, or at least may not appear precisely alike in those of the system which I described. I came next to speak of the earth in particular, and to show how, even though I had expressly supposed that God had given no weight to the matter of which it is composed, this should not prevent all its parts from tending exactly to its center; how with water and air on its surface, the disposition of the heavens and heavenly bodies, more especially of the moon, must cause a flow and ebb, like in all its circumstances to that observed in our seas, as also a certain current both of water and air from east to west, such as is likewise observed between the tropics; how the mountains, seas, fountains, and rivers might naturally be formed in it, and the metals produced in the mines, and the plants grow in the fields and in general, how all the bodies which are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and, among other things in the discoveries alluded to inasmuch as besides the stars, I knew nothing except fire which produces light, I spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature, -- the manner of its production and support, and to explain how heat is sometimes found without light, and light without heat; to show how it can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities; how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others; how it can consume almost all bodies, or convert them into ashes and smoke; and finally, how from these ashes, by the mere intensity of its action, it forms glass: for as this transmutation of ashes into glass appeared to me as wonderful as any other in nature, I took a special pleasure in describing it. I was not, however, disposed, from these circumstances, to conclude that this world had been created in the manner I described; for it is much more likely that God made it at the first such as it was to be. But this is certain, and an opinion commonly received among theologians, that the action by which he now sustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it; so that even although he had from the beginning given it no other form than that of chaos, provided only he had established certain laws of nature, and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do, it may be believed, without discredit to the miracle of creation, that, in this way alone, things purely material might, in course of time, have become such as we observe them at present; and their nature is much more easily conceived when they are beheld coming in this manner gradually into existence, than when they are only considered as produced at once in a finished and perfect state.\\r\\rFrom the description of inanimate bodies and plants, I passed to animals, and particularly to man. But since I had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the rest, that is to say, by deducing effects from their causes, and by showing from what elements and in what manner nature must produce them, I remained satisfied with the supposition that God formed the body of man wholly like to one of ours, as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal conformation of the organs, of the same matter with that I had described, and at first placed in it no rational soul, nor any other principle, in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul, beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light, such as I had already described, and which I thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry, or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit. For, when I examined the kind of functions which might, as consequences of this supposition, exist in this body, I found precisely all those which may exist in us independently of all power of thinking, and consequently without being in any measure owing to the soul; in other words, to that part of us which is distinct from the body, and of which it has been said above that the nature distinctively consists in thinking, functions in which the animals void of reason may be said wholly to resemble us; but among which I could not discover any of those that, as dependent on thought alone, belong to us as men, while, on the other hand, I did afterwards discover these as soon as I supposed God to have created a rational soul, and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which I described.\\r\\rBut, in order to show how I there handled this matter, I mean here to give the explication of the motion of the heart and arteries, which, as the first and most general motion observed in animals, will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest. And that there may be less difficulty in understanding what I am about to say on this subject, I advise those who are not versed in anatomy, before they commence the perusal of these observations, to take the trouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large animal possessed of lungs (for this is throughout sufficiently like the human), and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities: in the first place, that in the right side, with which correspond two very ample tubes, viz., the hollow vein (vena cava), which is the principal receptacle of the blood, and the trunk of the tree, as it were, of which all the other veins in the body are branches; and the arterial vein (vena arteriosa), inappropriately so denominated, since it is in truth only an artery, which, taking its rise in the heart, is divided, after passing out from it, into many branches which presently disperse themselves all over the lungs; in the second place, the cavity in the left side, with which correspond in the same manner two canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding, viz., the venous artery (arteria venosa), likewise inappropriately thus designated, because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs, where it is divided into many branches, interlaced with those of the arterial vein, and those of the tube called the windpipe, through which the air we breathe enters; and the great artery which, issuing from the heart, sends its branches all over the body. I should wish also that such persons were carefully shown the eleven pellicles which, like so many small valves, open and shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities, viz., three at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart, and yet exactly to prevent its flowing out; three at the entrance to the arterial vein, which, arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former, readily permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs, but hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity; and, in like manner, two others at the mouth of the venous artery, which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart, but preclude its return; and three at the mouth of the great artery, which suffer the blood to flow from the heart, but prevent its reflux. Nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation, can be adequately closed with two, whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three. Besides, I wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture than the venous artery and the hollow vein; and that the two last expand before entering the heart, and there form, as it were, two pouches denominated the auricles of the heart, which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself; and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body- and finally, that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate, just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel.',\n",
       " u'For, after these things, it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart, except that when its cavities are not full of blood, into these the blood of necessity flows, - - from the hollow vein into the right, and from the venous artery into the left; because these two vessels are always full of blood, and their orifices, which are turned towards the heart, cannot then be closed. But as soon as two drops of blood have thus passed, one into each of the cavities, these drops which cannot but be very large, because the orifices through which they pass are wide, and the vessels from which they come full of blood, are immediately rarefied, and dilated by the heat they meet with. In this way they cause the whole heart to expand, and at the same time press home and shut the five small valves that are at the entrances of the two vessels from which they flow, and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart, and becoming more and more rarefied, they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels, through which they pass out, causing in this way all the branches of the arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously with the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract, as do also the arteries, because the blood that has entered them has cooled, and the six small valves close, and the five of the hollow vein and of the venous artery open anew and allow a passage to other two drops of blood, which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as before. And, because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes through these two pouches called auricles, it thence happens that their motion is the contrary of that of the heart, and that when it expands they contract. But lest those who are ignorant of the force of mathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from mere verisimilitudes, should venture. without examination, to deny what has been said, I wish it to be considered that the motion which I have now explained follows as necessarily from the very arrangement of the parts, which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone, and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers, and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience, as does the motion of a clock from the power, the situation, and shape of its counterweights and wheels.\\r\\rBut if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins, flowing in this way continually into the heart, is not exhausted, and why the arteries do not become too full, since all the blood which passes through the heart flows into them, I need only mention in reply what has been written by a physician 1 of England, who has the honor of having broken the ice on this subject, and of having been the first to teach that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries, through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the small branches of the veins, whence it again returns to the heart; so that its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation. Of this we have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons, who, by binding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where they open the vein, cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have done without any ligature; whereas quite the contrary would happen were they to bind it below; that is, between the hand and the opening, or were to make the ligature above the opening very tight. For it is manifest that the tie, moderately straightened, while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins, cannot on that account prevent new blood from coming forward through the arteries, because these are situated below the veins, and their coverings, from their greater consistency, are more difficult to compress; and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins. And since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins, there must of necessity be certain passages below the ligature, that is, towards the extremities of the arm through which it can come thither from the arteries. This physician likewise abundantly establishes what he has advanced respecting the motion of the blood, from the existence of certain pellicles, so disposed in various places along the course of the veins, in the manner of small valves, as not to permit the blood to pass from the middle of the body towards the extremities, but only to return from the extremities to the heart; and farther, from experience which shows that all the blood which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut, even although this had been closely tied in the immediate neighborhood of the heart and cut between the heart and the ligature, so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart.\\r\\rBut there are many other circumstances which evince that what I have alleged is the true cause of the motion of the blood: thus, in the first place, the difference that is observed between the blood which flows from the veins, and that from the arteries, can only arise from this, that being rarefied, and, as it were, distilled by passing through the heart, it is thinner, and more vivid, and warmer immediately after leaving the heart, in other words, when in the arteries, than it was a short time before passing into either, in other words, when it was in the veins; and if attention be given, it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart; and is not so evident in parts more remote from it. In the next place, the consistency of the coats of which the arterial vein and the great artery are composed, sufficiently shows that the blood is impelled against them with more force than against the veins. And why should the left cavity of the heart and the great artery be wider and larger than the right cavity and the arterial vein, were it not that the blood of the venous artery, having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart, is thinner, and rarefies more readily, and in a higher degree, than the blood which proceeds immediately from the hollow vein? And what can physicians conjecture from feeling the pulse unless they know that according as the blood changes its nature it can be rarefied by the warmth of the heart, in a higher or lower degree, and more or less quickly than before? And if it be inquired how this heat is communicated to the other members, must it not be admitted that this is effected by means of the blood, which, passing through the heart, is there heated anew, and thence diffused over all the body? Whence it happens, that if the blood be withdrawn from any part, the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means; and although the heart were as-hot as glowing iron, it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands as at present, unless it continually sent thither new blood. We likewise perceive from this, that the true use of respiration is to bring sufficient fresh air into the lungs, to cause the blood which flows into them from the right ventricle of the heart, where it has been rarefied and, as it were, changed into vapors, to become thick, and to convert it anew into blood, before it flows into the left cavity, without which process it would be unfit for the nourishment of the fire that is there. This receives confirmation from the circumstance, that it is observed of animals destitute of lungs that they have also but one cavity in the heart, and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb, there is a hole through which the blood flows from the hollow vein into the left cavity of the heart, and a tube through which it passes from the arterial vein into the grand artery without passing through the lung. In the next place, how could digestion be carried on in the stomach unless the heart communicated heat to it through the arteries, and along with this certain of the more fluid parts of the blood, which assist in the dissolution of the food that has been taken in? Is not also the operation which converts the juice of food into blood easily comprehended, when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times in a day? And what more need be adduced to explain nutrition, and the production of the different humors of the body, beyond saying, that the force with which the blood, in being rarefied, passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries, causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive, and there occupy the place of some others expelled by them; and that according to the situation, shape, or smallness of the pores with which they meet, some rather than others flow into certain parts, in the same way that some sieves are observed to act, which, by being variously perforated, serve to separate different species of grain? And, in the last place, what above all is here worthy of observation, is the generation of the animal spirits, which are like a very subtle wind, or rather a very pure and vivid flame which, continually ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain, thence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles, and gives motion to all the members; so that to account for other parts of the blood which, as most agitated and penetrating, are the fittest to compose these spirits, proceeding towards the brain, it is not necessary to suppose any other cause, than simply, that the arteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart in the most direct lines, and that, according to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of nature, when many objects tend at once to the same point where there is not sufficient room for all (as is the case with the parts of the blood which flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain), the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it I had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the treatise which I formerly thought of publishing. And after these, I had shown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscles of the human body to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members, as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth, although no longer animated; what changes must take place in the brain to produce waking, sleep, and dreams; how light, sounds, odors, tastes, heat, and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means of the senses; how hunger, thirst, and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon it divers ideas; what must be understood by the common sense (sensus communis) in which these ideas are received, by the memory which retains them, by the fantasy which can change them in various ways, and out of them compose new ideas, and which, by the same means, distributing the animal spirits through the muscles, can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways, and in a manner as suited, whether to the objects that are presented to its senses or to its internal affections, as can take place in our own case apart from the guidance of the will. Nor will this appear at all strange to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different automata, or moving machines fabricated by human industry, and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones, muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and other parts that are found in the body of each animal. Such persons will look upon this body as a machine made by the hands of God, which is incomparably better arranged, and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine of human invention. And here I specially stayed to show that, were there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal, we could have no means of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature from these animals; but if there were machines bearing the image of our bodies, and capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible, there would still remain two most certain tests whereby to know that they were not therefore really men. Of these the first is that they could never use words or other signs arranged in such a manner as is competent to us in order to declare our thoughts to others: for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables, and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs; for example, if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it; if in another it may cry out that it is hurt, and such like; but not that it should arrange them variously so as appositely to reply to what is said in its presence, as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do. The second test is, that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us, they would, without doubt, fail in certain others from which it could be discovered that they did not act from knowledge, but solely from the disposition of their organs: for while reason is an universal instrument that is alike available on every occasion, these organs, on the contrary, need a particular arrangement for each particular action; whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient to enable it to act in all the occurrences of life, in the way in which our reason enables us to act. Again, by means of these two tests we may likewise know the difference between men and brutes. For it is highly deserving of remark, that there are no men so dull and stupid, not even idiots, as to be incapable of joining together different words, and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood; and that on the other hand, there is no other animal, however perfect or happily circumstanced, which can do the like. Nor does this inability arise from want of organs: for we observe that magpies and parrots can utter words like ourselves, and are yet unable to speak as we do, that is, so as to show that they understand what they say; in place of which men born deaf and dumb, and thus not less, but rather more than the brutes, destitute of the organs which others use in speaking, are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their thoughts to those who, being usually in their company, have leisure to learn their language. And this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than man, but that they have none at all: for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak; and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species, as well as among men, and since some are more capable of being instructed than others, it is incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of its species, should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack-brained, unless the soul of brutes were of a nature wholly different from ours. And we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions, and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals; nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients, that the brutes speak, although we do not understand their language. For if such were the case, since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours, they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows. It is also very worthy of remark, that, though there are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of their actions, the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in many others: so that the circumstance that they do better than we does not prove that they are endowed with mind, for it would thence follow that they possessed greater reason than any of us, and could surpass us in all things; on the contrary, it rather proves that they are destitute of reason, and that it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs: thus it is seen, that a clock composed only of wheels and weights can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin.\\r\\rI had after this described the reasonable soul, and shown that it could by no means be educed from the power of matter, as the other things of which I had spoken, but that it must be expressly created; and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship, unless perhaps to move its members, but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body, in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours, and thus constitute a real man. I here entered, in conclusion, upon the subject of the soul at considerable length, because it is of the greatest moment: for after the error of those who deny the existence of God, an error which I think I have already sufficiently refuted, there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue than the supposition that the soul of the brutes is of the same nature with our own; and consequently that after this life we have nothing to hope for or fear, more than flies and ants; in place of which, when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the reasons which establish that the soul is of a nature wholly independent of the body, and that consequently it is not liable to die with the latter and, finally, because no other causes are observed capable of destroying it, we are naturally led thence to judge that it is immortal.',\n",
       " u'Three years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise containing all these matters; and I was beginning to revise it, with the view to put it into the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom I greatly defer, and whose authority over my actions is hardly less influential than is my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a certain doctrine in physics, published a short time previously by another individual to which I will not say that I adhered, but only that, previously to their censure I had observed in it nothing which I could imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state, and nothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression to it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; and this led me to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found in which I had departed from the truth, notwithstanding the great care I have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had not the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to aught that might tend to the hurt of any one. This has been sufficient to make me alter my purpose of publishing them; for although the reasons by which I had been induced to take this resolution were very strong, yet my inclination, which has always been hostile to writing books, enabled me immediately to discover other considerations sufficient to excuse me for not undertaking the task. And these reasons, on one side and the other, are such, that not only is it in some measure my interest here to state them, but that of the public, perhaps, to know them.\\r\\rI have never made much account of what has proceeded from my own mind; and so long as I gathered no other advantage from the method I employ beyond satisfying myself on some difficulties belonging to the speculative sciences, or endeavoring to regulate my actions according to the principles it taught me, I never thought myself bound to publish anything respecting it. For in what regards manners, every one is so full of his own wisdom, that there might be found as many reformers as heads, if any were allowed to take upon themselves the task of mending them, except those whom God has constituted the supreme rulers of his people or to whom he has given sufficient grace and zeal to be prophets; and although my speculations greatly pleased myself, I believed that others had theirs, which perhaps pleased them still more. But as soon as I had acquired some general notions respecting physics, and beginning to make trial of them in various particular difficulties, had observed how far they can carry us, and how much they differ from the principles that have been employed up to the present time, I believed that I could not keep them concealed without sinning grievously against the law by which we are bound to promote, as far as in us lies, the general good of mankind. For by them I perceived it to be possible to arrive at knowledge highly useful in life; and in room of the speculative philosophy usually taught in the schools, to discover a practical, by means of which, knowing the force and action of fire, water, air the stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies that surround us, as distinctly as we know the various crafts of our artisans, we might also apply them in the same way to all the uses to which they are adapted, and thus render ourselves the lords and possessors of nature. And this is a result to be desired, not only in order to the invention of an infinity of arts, by which we might be enabled to enjoy without any trouble the fruits of the earth, and all its comforts, but also and especially for the preservation of health, which is without doubt, of all the blessings of this life, the first and fundamental one; for the mind is so intimately dependent upon the condition and relation of the organs of the body, that if any means can ever be found to render men wiser and more ingenious than hitherto, I believe that it is in medicine they must be sought for. It is true that the science of medicine, as it now exists, contains few things whose utility is very remarkable: but without any wish to depreciate it, I am confident that there is no one, even among those whose profession it is, who does not admit that all at present known in it is almost nothing in comparison of what remains to be discovered; and that we could free ourselves from an infinity of maladies of body as well as of mind, and perhaps also even from the debility of age, if we had sufficiently ample knowledge of their causes, and of all the remedies provided for us by nature. But since I designed to employ my whole life in the search after so necessary a science, and since I had fallen in with a path which seems to me such, that if any one follow it he must inevitably reach the end desired, unless he be hindered either by the shortness of life or the want of experiments, I judged that there could be no more effectual provision against these two impediments than if I were faithfully to communicate to the public all the little I might myself have found, and incite men of superior genius to strive to proceed farther, by contributing, each according to his inclination and ability, to the experiments which it would be necessary to make, and also by informing the public of all they might discover, so that, by the last beginning where those before them had left off, and thus connecting the lives and labours of many, we might collectively proceed much farther than each by himself could do.\\r\\rI remarked, moreover, with respect to experiments, that they become always more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge; for, at the commencement, it is better to make use only of what is spontaneously presented to our senses, and of which we cannot remain ignorant, provided we bestow on it any reflection, however slight, than to concern ourselves about more uncommon and recondite phenomena: the reason of which is, that the more uncommon often only mislead us so long as the causes of the more ordinary are still unknown; and the circumstances upon which they depend are almost always so special and minute as to be highly difficult to detect. But in this I have adopted the following order: first, I have essayed to find in general the principles, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world, without taking into consideration for this end anything but God himself who has created it, and without educing them from any other source than from certain germs of truths naturally existing in our minds In the second place, I examined what were the first and most ordinary effects that could be deduced from these causes; and it appears to me that, in this way, I have found heavens, stars, an earth, and even on the earth water, air, fire, minerals, and some other things of this kind, which of all others are the most common and simple, and hence the easiest to know. Afterwards when I wished to descend to the more particular, so many diverse objects presented themselves to me, that I believed it to be impossible for the human mind to distinguish the forms or species of bodies that are upon the earth, from an infinity of others which might have been, if it had pleased God to place them there, or consequently to apply them to our use, unless we rise to causes through their effects, and avail ourselves of many particular experiments. Thereupon, turning over in my mind I the objects that had ever been presented to my senses I freely venture to state that I have never observed any which I could not satisfactorily explain by the principles had discovered. But it is necessary also to confess that the power of nature is so ample and vast, and these principles so simple and general, that I have hardly observed a single particular effect which I cannot at once recognize as capable of being deduced in man different modes from the principles, and that my greatest difficulty usually is to discover in which of these modes the effect is dependent upon them; for out of this difficulty cannot otherwise extricate myself than by again seeking certain experiments, which may be such that their result is not the same, if it is in the one of these modes at we must explain it, as it would be if it were to be explained in the other. As to what remains, I am now in a position to discern, as I think, with sufficient clearness what course must be taken to make the majority those experiments which may conduce to this end: but I perceive likewise that they are such and so numerous, that neither my hands nor my income, though it were a thousand times larger than it is, would be sufficient for them all; so that according as henceforward I shall have the means of making more or fewer experiments, I shall in the same proportion make greater or less progress in the knowledge of nature. This was what I had hoped to make known by the treatise I had written, and so clearly to exhibit the advantage that would thence accrue to the public, as to induce all who have the common good of man at heart, that is, all who are virtuous in truth, and not merely in appearance, or according to opinion, as well to communicate to me the experiments they had already made, as to assist me in those that remain to be made.\\r\\rBut since that time other reasons have occurred to me, by which I have been led to change my opinion, and to think that I ought indeed to go on committing to writing all the results which I deemed of any moment, as soon as I should have tested their truth, and to bestow the same care upon them as I would have done had it been my design to publish them. This course commended itself to me, as well because I thus afforded myself more ample inducement to examine them thoroughly, for doubtless that is always more narrowly scrutinized which we believe will be read by many, than that which is written merely for our private use (and frequently what has seemed to me true when I first conceived it, has appeared false when I have set about committing it to writing), as because I thus lost no opportunity of advancing the interests of the public, as far as in me lay, and since thus likewise, if my writings possess any value, those into whose hands they may fall after my death may be able to put them to what use they deem proper. But I resolved by no means to consent to their publication during my lifetime, lest either the oppositions or the controversies to which they might give rise, or even the reputation, such as it might be, which they would acquire for me, should be any occasion of my losing the time that I had set apart for my own improvement. For though it be true that every one is bound to promote to the extent of his ability the good of others, and that to be useful to no one is really to be worthless, yet it is likewise true that our cares ought to extend beyond the present, and it is good to omit doing what might perhaps bring some profit to the living, when we have in view the accomplishment of other ends that will be of much greater advantage to posterity. And in truth, I am quite willing it should be known that the little I have hitherto learned is almost nothing in comparison with that of which I am ignorant, and to the knowledge of which I do not despair of being able to attain; for it is much the same with those who gradually discover truth in the sciences, as with those who when growing rich find less difficulty in making great acquisitions, than they formerly experienced when poor in making acquisitions of much smaller amount. Or they may be compared to the commanders of armies, whose forces usually increase in proportion to their victories, and who need greater prudence to keep together the residue of their troops after a defeat than after a victory to take towns and provinces. For he truly engages in battle who endeavors to surmount all the difficulties and errors which prevent him from reaching the knowledge of truth, and he is overcome in fight who admits a false opinion touching a matter of any generality and importance, and he requires thereafter much more skill to recover his former position than to make great advances when once in possession of thoroughly ascertained principles. As for myself, if I have succeeded in discovering any truths in the sciences (and I trust that what is contained in this volume 1 will show that I have found some), I can declare that they are but the consequences and results of five or six principal difficulties which I have surmounted, and my encounters with which I reckoned as battles in which victory declared for me. I will not hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to enable me fully to realize my designs than to gain two or three similar victories; and that I am not so far advanced in years but that, according to the ordinary course of nature, I may still have sufficient leisure for this end. But I conceive myself the more bound to husband the time that remains the greater my expectation of being able to employ it aright, and I should doubtless have much to rob me of it, were I to publish the principles of my physics: for although they are almost all so evident that to assent to them no more is needed than simply to understand them, and although there is not one of them of which I do not expect to be able to give demonstration, yet, as it is impossible that they can be in accordance with all the diverse opinions of others, I foresee that I should frequently be turned aside from my grand design, on occasion of the opposition which they would be sure to awaken.\\r\\rIt may be said, that these oppositions would be useful both in making me aware of my errors, and, if my speculations contain anything of value, in bringing others to a fuller understanding of it; and still farther, as many can see better than one, in leading others who are now beginning to avail themselves of my principles, to assist me in turn with their discoveries. But though I recognize my extreme liability to error, and scarce ever trust to the first thoughts which occur to me, yet-the experience I have had of possible objections to my views prevents me from anticipating any profit from them. For I have already had frequent proof of the judgments, as well of those I esteemed friends, as of some others to whom I thought I was an object of indifference, and even of some whose malignancy and envy would, I knew, determine them to endeavor to discover what partiality concealed from the eyes of my friends. But it has rarely happened that anything has been objected to me which I had myself altogether overlooked, unless it were something far removed from the subject: so that I have never met with a single critic of my opinions who did not appear to me either less rigorous or less equitable than myself. And further, I have never observed that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the disputations that are practised in the schools; for while each strives for the victory, each is much more occupied in making the best of mere verisimilitude, than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the question; and those who have been long good advocates are not afterwards on that account the better judges.\\r\\rAs for the advantage that others would derive from the communication of my thoughts, it could not be very great; because I have not yet so far prosecuted them as that much does not remain to be added before they can be applied to practice. And I think I may say without vanity, that if there is any one who can carry them out that length, it must be myself rather than another: not that there may not be in the world many minds incomparably superior to mine, but because one cannot so well seize a thing and make it one\\'s own, when it has been learned from another, as when one has himself discovered it. And so true is this of the present subject that, though I have often explained some of my opinions to persons of much acuteness, who, whilst I was speaking, appeared to understand them very distinctly, yet, when they repeated them, I have observed that they almost always changed them to such an extent that I could no longer acknowledge them as mine. I am glad, by the way, to take this opportunity of requesting posterity never to believe on hearsay that anything has proceeded from me which has not been published by myself; and I am not at all astonished at the extravagances attributed to those ancient philosophers whose own writings we do not possess; whose thoughts, however, I do not on that account suppose to have been really absurd, seeing they were among the ablest men of their times, but only that these have been falsely represented to us. It is observable, accordingly, that scarcely in a single instance has any one of their disciples surpassed them; and I am quite sure that the most devoted of the present followers of Aristotle would think themselves happy if they had as much knowledge of nature as he possessed, were it even under the condition that they should never afterwards attain to higher. In this respect they are like the ivy which never strives to rise above the tree that sustains it, and which frequently even returns downwards when it has reached the top; for it seems to me that they also sink, in other words, render themselves less wise than they would be if they gave up study, who, not contented with knowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, desire in addition to find in him the solution of many difficulties of which he says not a word, and never perhaps so much as thought. Their fashion of philosophizing, however, is well suited to persons whose abilities fall below mediocrity; for the obscurity of the distinctions and principles of which they make use enables them to speak of all things with as much confidence as if they really knew them, and to defend all that they say on any subject against the most subtle and skillful, without its being possible for any one to convict them of error. In this they seem to me to be like a blind man, who, in order to fight on equal terms with a person that sees, should have made him descend to the bottom of an intensely dark cave: and I may say that such persons have an interest in my refraining from publishing the principles of the philosophy of which I make use; for, since these are of a kind the simplest and most evident, I should, by publishing them, do much the same as if I were to throw open the windows, and allow the light of day to enter the cave into which the combatants had descended. But even superior men have no reason for any great anxiety to know these principles, for if what they desire is to be able to speak of all things, and to acquire a reputation for learning, they will gain their end more easily by remaining satisfied with the appearance of truth, which can be found without much difficulty in all sorts of matters, than by seeking the truth itself which unfolds itself but slowly and that only in some departments, while it obliges us, when we have to speak of others, freely to confess our ignorance. If, however, they prefer the knowledge of some few truths to the vanity of appearing ignorant of none, as such knowledge is undoubtedly much to be preferred, and, if they choose to follow a course similar to mine, they do not require for this that I should say anything more than I have already said in this discourse. For if they are capable of making greater advancement than I have made, they will much more be able of themselves to discover all that I believe myself to have found; since as I have never examined aught except in order, it is certain that what yet remains to be discovered is in itself more difficult and recondite, than that which I have already been enabled to find, and the gratification would be much less in learning it from me than in discovering it for themselves. Besides this, the habit which they will acquire, by seeking first what is easy, and then passing onward slowly and step by step to the more difficult, will benefit them more than all my instructions. Thus, in my own case, I am persuaded that if I had been taught from my youth all the truths of which I have since sought out demonstrations, and had thus learned them without labour, I should never, perhaps, have known any beyond these; at least, I should never have acquired the habit and the facility which I think I possess in always discovering new truths in proportion as I give myself to the search. And, in a single word, if there is any work in the world which cannot be so well finished by another as by him who has commenced it, it is that at which I labour.\\r\\rIt is true, indeed, as regards the experiments which may conduce to this end, that one man is not equal to the task of making them all; but yet he can advantageously avail himself, in this work, of no hands besides his own, unless those of artisans, or parties of the same kind, whom he could pay, and whom the hope of gain (a means of great efficacy) might stimulate to accuracy in the performance of what was prescribed to them. For as to those who, through curiosity or a desire of learning, of their own accord, perhaps, offer him their services, besides that in general their promises exceed their performance, and that they sketch out fine designs of which not one is ever realized, they will, without doubt, expect to be compensated for their trouble by the explication of some difficulties, or, at least, by compliments and useless speeches, in which he cannot spend any portion of his time without loss to himself. And as for the experiments that others have already made, even although these parties should be willing of themselves to communicate them to him (which is what those who esteem them secrets will never do), the experiments are, for the most part, accompanied with so many circumstances and superfluous elements, as to make it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the truth from its adjuncts- besides, he will find almost all of them so ill described, or even so false (because those who made them have wished to see in them only such facts as they deemed conformable to their principles), that, if in the entire number there should be some of a nature suited to his purpose, still their value could not compensate for the time what would be necessary to make the selection. So that if there existed any one whom we assuredly knew to be capable of making discoveries of the highest kind, and of the greatest possible utility to the public; and if all other men were therefore eager by all means to assist him in successfully prosecuting his designs, I do not see that they could do aught else for him beyond contributing to defray the expenses of the experiments that might be necessary; and for the rest, prevent his being deprived of his leisure by the unseasonable interruptions of any one. But besides that I neither have so high an opinion of myself as to be willing to make promise of anything extraordinary, nor feed on imaginations so vain as to fancy that the public must be much interested in my designs; I do not, on the other hand, own a soul so mean as to be capable of accepting from any one a favor of which it could be supposed that I was unworthy.\\r\\rThese considerations taken together were the reason why, for the last three years, I have been unwilling to publish the treatise I had on hand, and why I even resolved to give publicity during my life to no other that was so general, or by which the principles of my physics might be understood. But since then, two other reasons have come into operation that have determined me here to subjoin some particular specimens, and give the public some account of my doings and designs. Of these considerations, the first is, that if I failed to do so, many who were cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writings, might have imagined that the reasons which induced me to refrain from so doing, were less to my credit than they really are; for although I am not immoderately desirous of glory, or even, if I may venture so to say, although I am averse from it in so far as I deem it hostile to repose which I hold in greater account than aught else, yet, at the same time, I have never sought to conceal my actions as if they were crimes, nor made use of many precautions that I might remain unknown; and this partly because I should have thought such a course of conduct a wrong against myself, and partly because it would have occasioned me some sort of uneasiness which would again have been contrary to the perfect mental tranquillity which I court. And forasmuch as, while thus indifferent to the thought alike of fame or of forgetfulness, I have yet been unable to prevent myself from acquiring some sort of reputation, I have thought it incumbent on me to do my best to save myself at least from being ill-spoken of. The other reason that has determined me to commit to writing these specimens of philosophy is, that I am becoming daily more and more alive to the delay which my design of self-instruction suffers, for want of the infinity of experiments I require, and which it is impossible for me to make without the assistance of others: and, without flattering myself so much as to expect the public to take a large share in my interests, I am yet unwilling to be found so far wanting in the duty I owe to myself, as to give occasion to those who shall survive me to make it matter of reproach against me some day, that I might have left them many things in a much more perfect state than I have done, had I not too much neglected to make them aware of the ways in which they could have promoted the accomplishment of my designs.\\r\\rAnd I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which should neither be obnoxious to much controversy, nor should compel me to expound more of my principles than I desired, and which should yet be sufficient clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the sciences. Whether or not I have succeeded in this it is not for me to say; and I do not wish to forestall the judgments of others by speaking myself of my writings; but it will gratify me if they be examined, and, to afford the greater inducement to this I request all who may have any objections to make to them, to take the trouble of forwarding these to my publisher, who will give me notice of them, that I may endeavor to subjoin at the same time my reply; and in this way readers seeing both at once will more easily determine where the truth lies; for I do not engage in any case to make prolix replies, but only with perfect frankness to avow my errors if I am convinced of them, or if I cannot perceive them, simply to state what I think is required for defense of the matters I have written, adding thereto no explication of any new matte that it may not be necessary to pass without end from one thing to another.\\r\\rIf some of the matters of which I have spoken in the beginning of the \"Dioptrics\" and \"Meteorics\" should offend at first sight, because I call them hypotheses and seem indifferent about giving proof of them, I request a patient and attentive reading of the whole, from which I hope those hesitating will derive satisfaction; for it appears to me that the reasonings are so mutually connected in these treatises, that, as the last are demonstrated by the first which are their causes, the first are in their turn demonstrated by the last which are their effects. Nor must it be imagined that I here commit the fallacy which the logicians call a circle; for since experience renders the majority of these effects most certain, the causes from which I deduce them do not serve so much to establish their reality as to explain their existence; but on the contrary, the reality of the causes is established by the reality of the effects. Nor have I called them hypotheses with any other end in view except that it may be known that I think I am able to deduce them from those first truths which I have already expounded; and yet that I have expressly determined not to do so, to prevent a certain class of minds from thence taking occasion to build some extravagant philosophy upon what they may take to be my principles, and my being blamed for it. I refer to those who imagine that they can master in a day all that another has taken twenty years to think out, as soon as he has spoken two or three words to them on the subject; or who are the more liable to error and the less capable of perceiving truth in very proportion as they are more subtle and lively. As to the opinions which are truly and wholly mine, I offer no apology for them as new, -- persuaded as I am that if their reasons be well considered they will be found to be so simple and so conformed, to common sense as to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than any others which can be held on the same subjects; nor do I even boast of being the earliest discoverer of any of them, but only of having adopted them, neither because they had nor because they had not been held by others, but solely because reason has convinced me of their truth.\\r\\rThough artisans may not be able at once to execute the invention which is explained in the \"Dioptrics,\" I do not think that any one on that account is entitled to condemn it; for since address and practice are required in order so to make and adjust the machines described by me as not to overlook the smallest particular, I should not be less astonished if they succeeded on the first attempt than if a person were in one day to become an accomplished performer on the guitar, by merely having excellent sheets of music set up before him. And if I write in French, which is the language of my country, in preference to Latin, which is that of my preceptors, it is because I expect that those who make use of their unprejudiced natural reason will be better judges of my opinions than those who give heed to the writings of the ancients only; and as for those who unite good sense with habits of study, whom alone I desire for judges, they will not, I feel assured, be so partial to Latin as to refuse to listen to my reasonings merely because I expound them in the vulgar tongue.\\r\\rIn conclusion, I am unwilling here to say anything very specific of the progress which I expect to make for the future in the sciences, or to bind myself to the public by any promise which I am not certain of being able to fulfill; but this only will I say, that I have resolved to devote what time I may still have to live to no other occupation than that of endeavoring to acquire some knowledge of Nature, which shall be of such a kind as to enable us therefrom to deduce rules in medicine of greater certainty than those at present in use; and that my inclination is so much opposed to all other pursuits, especially to such as cannot be useful to some without being hurtful to others, that if, by any circumstances, I had been constrained to engage in such, I do not believe that I should have been able to succeed. Of this I here make a public declaration, though well aware that it cannot serve to procure for me any consideration in the world, which, however, I do not in the least affect; and I shall always hold myself more obliged to those through whose favor I am permitted to enjoy my retirement without interruption than to any who might offer me the highest earthly preferments.',\n",
       " u'My present design, then, is not to teach the method which each ought to follow for the right conduct of his reason, but solely to describe the way in which I have endeavored to conduct my own. They who set themselves to give precepts must of course regard themselves as possessed of greater skill than those to whom they prescribe; and if they err in the slightest particular, they subject themselves to censure. But as this tract is put forth merely as a history, or, if you will, as a tale, in which, amid some examples worthy of imitation, there will be found, perhaps, as many more which it were advisable not to follow, I hope it will prove useful to some without being hurtful to any, and that my openness will find some favor with all.\\r\\rFrom my childhood, I have been familiar with letters; and as I was given to believe that by their help a clear and certain knowledge of all that is useful in life might be acquired, I was ardently desirous of instruction. But as soon as I had finished the entire course of study, at the close of which it is customary to be admitted into the order of the learned, I completely changed my opinion. For I found myself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I had advanced no farther in all my attempts at learning, than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance. And yet I was studying in one of the most celebrated schools in Europe, in which I thought there must be learned men, if such were anywhere to be found. I had been taught all that others learned there; and not contented with the sciences actually taught us, I had, in addition, read all the books that had fallen into my hands, treating of such branches as are esteemed the most curious and rare. I knew the judgment which others had formed of me; and I did not find that I was considered inferior to my fellows, although there were among them some who were already marked out to fill the places of our instructors. And, in fine, our age appeared to me as flourishing, and as fertile in powerful minds as any preceding one. I was thus led to take the liberty of judging of all other men by myself, and of concluding that there was no science in existence that was of such a nature as I had previously been given to believe.\\r\\rI still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the schools. I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary to the understanding of the writings of the ancients; that the grace of fable stirs the mind; that the memorable deeds of history elevate it; and, if read with discretion, aid in forming the judgment; that the perusal of all excellent books is, as it were, to interview with the noblest men of past ages, who have written them, and even a studied interview, in which are discovered to us only their choicest thoughts; that eloquence has incomparable force and beauty; that poesy has its ravishing graces and delights; that in the mathematics there are many refined discoveries eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive, as well as further all the arts an lessen the labour of man; that numerous highly useful precepts and exhortations to virtue are contained in treatises on morals; that theology points out the path to heaven; that philosophy affords the means of discoursing with an appearance of truth on all matters, and commands the admiration of the more simple; that jurisprudence, medicine, and the other sciences, secure for their cultivators honors and riches; and, in fine, that it is useful to bestow some attention upon all, even upon those abounding the most in superstition and error, that we may be in a position to determine their real value, and guard against being deceived.\\r\\rBut I believed that I had already given sufficient time to languages, and likewise to the reading of the writings of the ancients, to their histories and fables. For to hold converse with those of other ages and to travel, are almost the same thing. It is useful to know something of the manners of different nations, that we may be enabled to form a more correct judgment regarding our own, and be prevented from thinking that everything contrary to our customs is ridiculous and irrational, a conclusion usually come to by those whose experience has been limited to their own country. On the other hand, when too much time is occupied in traveling, we become strangers to our native country; and the over curious in the customs of the past are generally ignorant of those of the present. Besides, fictitious narratives lead us to imagine the possibility of many events that are impossible; and even the most faithful histories, if they do not wholly misrepresent matters, or exaggerate their importance to render the account of them more worthy of perusal, omit, at least, almost always the meanest and least striking of the attendant circumstances; hence it happens that the remainder does not represent the truth, and that such as regulate their conduct by examples drawn from this source, are apt to fall into the extravagances of the knight-errants of romance, and to entertain projects that exceed their powers.\\r\\rI esteemed eloquence highly, and was in raptures with poesy; but I thought that both were gifts of nature rather than fruits of study. Those in whom the faculty of reason is predominant, and who most skillfully dispose their thoughts with a view to render them clear and intelligible, are always the best able to persuade others of the truth of what they lay down, though they should speak only in the language of Lower Brittany, and be wholly ignorant of the rules of rhetoric; and those whose minds are stored with the most agreeable fancies, and who can give expression to them with the greatest embellishment and harmony, are still the best poets, though unacquainted with the art of poetry.\\r\\rI was especially delighted with the mathematics, on account of the certitude and evidence of their reasonings; but I had not as yet a precise knowledge of their true use; and thinking that they but contributed to the advancement of the mechanical arts, I was astonished that foundations, so strong and solid, should have had no loftier superstructure reared on them. On the other hand, I compared the disquisitions of the ancient moralists to very towering and magnificent palaces with no better foundation than sand and mud: they laud the virtues very highly, and exhibit them as estimable far above anything on earth; but they give us no adequate criterion of virtue, and frequently that which they designate with so fine a name is but apathy, or pride, or despair, or parricide.',\n",
       " u'I revered our theology, and aspired as much as any one to reach heaven: but being given assuredly to understand that the way is not less open to the most ignorant than to the most learned, and that the revealed truths which lead to heaven are above our comprehension, I did not presume to subject them to the impotency of my reason; and I thought that in order competently to undertake their examination, there was need of some special help from heaven, and of being more than man.\\r\\rOf philosophy I will say nothing, except that when I saw that it had been cultivated for many ages by the most distinguished men, and that yet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is not still in dispute, and nothing, therefore, which is above doubt, I did not presume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that of others; and further, when I considered the number of conflicting opinions touching a single matter that may be upheld by learned men, while there can be but one true, I reckoned as well-nigh false all that was only probable.\\r\\rAs to the other sciences, inasmuch as these borrow their principles from philosophy, I judged that no solid superstructures could be reared on foundations so infirm; and neither the honor nor the gain held out by them was sufficient to determine me to their cultivation: for I was not, thank Heaven, in a condition which compelled me to make merchandise of science for the bettering of my fortune; and though I might not profess to scorn glory as a cynic, I yet made very slight account of that honor which I hoped to acquire only through fictitious titles. And, in fine, of false sciences I thought I knew the worth sufficiently to escape being deceived by the professions of an alchemist, the predictions of an astrologer, the impostures of a magician, or by the artifices and boasting of any of those who profess to know things of which they are ignorant.\\r\\rFor these reasons, as soon as my age permitted me to pass from under the control of my instructors, I entirely abandoned the study of letters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the knowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world. I spent the remainder of my youth in traveling, in visiting courts and armies, in holding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, in collecting varied experience, in proving myself in the different situations into which fortune threw me, and, above all, in making such reflection on the matter of my experience as to secure my improvement. For it occurred to me that I should find much more truth in the reasonings of each individual with reference to the affairs in which he is personally interested, and the issue of which must presently punish him if he has judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of letters in his study, regarding speculative matters that are of no practical moment, and followed by no consequences to himself, farther, perhaps, than that they foster his vanity the better the more remote they are from common sense; requiring, as they must in this case, the exercise of greater ingenuity and art to render them probable. In addition, I had always a most earnest desire to know how to distinguish the true from the false, in order that I might be able clearly to discriminate the right path in life, and proceed in it with confidence.\\r\\rIt is true that, while busied only in considering the manners of other men, I found here, too, scarce any ground for settled conviction, and remarked hardly less contradiction among them than in the opinions of the philosophers. So that the greatest advantage I derived from the study consisted in this, that, observing many things which, however extravagant and ridiculous to our apprehension, are yet by common consent received and approved by other great nations, I learned to entertain too decided a belief in regard to nothing of the truth of which I had been persuaded merely by example and custom; and thus I gradually extricated myself from many errors powerful enough to darken our natural intelligence, and incapacitate us in great measure from listening to reason. But after I had been occupied several years in thus studying the book of the world, and in essaying to gather some experience, I at length resolved to make myself an object of study, and to employ all the powers of my mind in choosing the paths I ought to follow, an undertaking which was accompanied with greater success than it would have been had I never quitted my country or my books.',\n",
       " u'I was then in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country, which have not yet been brought to a termination; and as I was returning to the army from the coronation of the emperor, the setting in of winter arrested me in a locality where, as I found no society to interest me, and was besides fortunately undisturbed by any cares or passions, I remained the whole day in seclusion, with full opportunity to occupy my attention with my own thoughts. Of these one of the very first that occurred to me was, that there is seldom so much perfection in works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands had been employed, as in those completed by a single master. Thus it is observable that the buildings which a single architect has planned and executed, are generally more elegant and commodious than those which several have attempted to improve, by making old walls serve for purposes for which they were not originally built. Thus also, those ancient cities which, from being at first only villages, have become, in course of time, large towns, are usually but ill laid out compared with the regularity constructed towns which a professional architect has freely planned on an open plain; so that although the several buildings of the former may often equal or surpass in beauty those of the latter, yet when one observes their indiscriminate juxtaposition, there a large one and here a small, and the consequent crookedness and irregularity of the streets, one is disposed to allege that chance rather than any human will guided by reason must have led to such an arrangement. And if we consider that nevertheless there have been at all times certain officers whose duty it was to see that private buildings contributed to public ornament, the difficulty of reaching high perfection with but the materials of others to operate on, will be readily acknowledged. In the same way I fancied that those nations which, starting from a semi-barbarous state and advancing to civilization by slow degrees, have had their laws successively determined, and, as it were, forced upon them simply by experience of the hurtfulness of particular crimes and disputes, would by this process come to be possessed of less perfect institutions than those which, from the commencement of their association as communities, have followed the appointments of some wise legislator. It is thus quite certain that the constitution of the true religion, the ordinances of which are derived from God, must be incomparably superior to that of every other. And, to speak of human affairs, I believe that the pre-eminence of Sparta was due not to the goodness of each of its laws in particular, for many of these were very strange, and even opposed to good morals, but to the circumstance that, originated by a single individual, they all tended to a single end. In the same way I thought that the sciences contained in books (such of them at least as are made up of probable reasonings, without demonstrations), composed as they are of the opinions of many different individuals massed together, are farther removed from truth than the simple inferences which a man of good sense using his natural and unprejudiced judgment draws respecting the matters of his experience. And because we have all to pass through a state of infancy to manhood, and have been of necessity, for a length of time, governed by our desires and preceptors (whose dictates were frequently conflicting, while neither perhaps always counseled us for the best), I farther concluded that it is almost impossible that our judgments can be so correct or solid as they would have been, had our reason been mature from the moment of our birth, and had we always been guided by it alone.\\r\\rIt is true, however, that it is not customary to pull down all the houses of a town with the single design of rebuilding them differently, and thereby rendering the streets more handsome; but it often happens that a private individual takes down his own with the view of erecting it anew, and that people are even sometimes constrained to this when their houses are in danger of falling from age, or when the foundations are insecure. With this before me by way of example, I was persuaded that it would indeed be preposterous for a private individual to think of reforming a state by fundamentally changing it throughout, and overturning it in order to set it up amended; and the same I thought was true of any similar project for reforming the body of the sciences, or the order of teaching them established in the schools: but as for the opinions which up to that time I had embraced, I thought that I could not do better than resolve at once to sweep them wholly away, that I might afterwards be in a position to admit either others more correct, or even perhaps the same when they had undergone the scrutiny of reason. I firmly believed that in this way I should much better succeed in the conduct of my life, than if I built only upon old foundations, and leaned upon principles which, in my youth, I had taken upon trust. For although I recognized various difficulties in this undertaking, these were not, however, without remedy, nor once to be compared with such as attend the slightest reformation in public affairs. Large bodies, if once overthrown, are with great difficulty set up again, or even kept erect when once seriously shaken, and the fall of such is always disastrous. Then if there are any imperfections in the constitutions of states (and that many such exist the diversity of constitutions is alone sufficient to assure us), custom has without doubt materially smoothed their inconveniences, and has even managed to steer altogether clear of, or insensibly corrected a number which sagacity could not have provided against with equal effect; and, in fine, the defects are almost always more tolerable than the change necessary for their removal; in the same manner that highways which wind among mountains, by being much frequented, become gradually so smooth and commodious, that it is much better to follow them than to seek a straighter path by climbing over the tops of rocks and descending to the bottoms of precipices.',\n",
       " u\"Hence it is that I cannot in any degree approve of those restless and busy meddlers who, called neither by birth nor fortune to take part in the management of public affairs, are yet always projecting reforms; and if I thought that this tract contained aught which might justify the suspicion that I was a victim of such folly, I would by no means permit its publication. I have never contemplated anything higher than the reformation of my own opinions, and basing them on a foundation wholly my own. And although my own satisfaction with my work has led me to present here a draft of it, I do not by any means therefore recommend to every one else to make a similar attempt. Those whom God has endowed with a larger measure of genius will entertain, perhaps, designs still more exalted; but for the many I am much afraid lest even the present undertaking be more than they can safely venture to imitate. The single design to strip one's self of all past beliefs is one that ought not to be taken by every one. The majority of men is composed of two classes, for neither of which would this be at all a befitting resolution: in the first place, of those who with more than a due confidence in their own powers, are precipitate in their judgments and want the patience requisite for orderly and circumspect thinking; whence it happens, that if men of this class once take the liberty to doubt of their accustomed opinions, and quit the beaten highway, they will never be able to thread the byway that would lead them by a shorter course, and will lose themselves and continue to wander for life; in the second place, of those who, possessed of sufficient sense or modesty to determine that there are others who excel them in the power of discriminating between truth and error, and by whom they may be instructed, ought rather to content themselves with the opinions of such than trust for more correct to their own reason.\\r\\rFor my own part, I should doubtless have belonged to the latter class, had I received instruction from but one master, or had I never known the diversities of opinion that from time immemorial have prevailed among men of the greatest learning. But I had become aware, even so early as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and incredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on of the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I remarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours are not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary that many of these nations make an equally good, if not better, use of their reason than we do. I took into account also the very different character which a person brought up from infancy in France or Germany exhibits, from that which, with the same mind originally, this individual would have possessed had he lived always among the Chinese or with savages, and the circumstance that in dress itself the fashion which pleased us ten years ago, and which may again, perhaps, be received into favor before ten years have gone, appears to us at this moment extravagant and ridiculous. I was thus led to infer that the ground of our opinions is far more custom and example than any certain knowledge. And, finally, although such be the ground of our opinions, I remarked that a plurality of suffrages is no guarantee of truth where it is at all of difficult discovery, as in such cases it is much more likely that it will be found by one than by many. I could, however, select from the crowd no one whose opinions seemed worthy of preference, and thus I found myself constrained, as it were, to use my own reason in the conduct of my life.\\r\\rBut like one walking alone and in the dark, I resolved to proceed so slowly and with such circumspection, that if I did not advance far, I would at least guard against falling. I did not even choose to dismiss summarily any of the opinions that had crept into my belief without having been introduced by reason, but first of all took sufficient time carefully to satisfy myself of the general nature of the task I was setting myself, and ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the knowledge of whatever lay within the compass of my powers.\\r\\rAmong the branches of philosophy, I had, at an earlier period, given some attention to logic, and among those of the mathematics to geometrical analysis and algebra, -- three arts or sciences which ought, as I conceived, to contribute something to my design. But, on examination, I found that, as for logic, its syllogisms and the majority of its other precepts are of avail- rather in the communication of what we already know, or even as the art of Lully, in speaking without judgment of things of which we are ignorant, than in the investigation of the unknown; and although this science contains indeed a number of correct and very excellent precepts, there are, nevertheless, so many others, and these either injurious or superfluous, mingled with the former, that it is almost quite as difficult to effect a severance of the true from the false as it is to extract a Diana or a Minerva from a rough block of marble. Then as to the analysis of the ancients and the algebra of the moderns, besides that they embrace only matters highly abstract, and, to appearance, of no use, the former is so exclusively restricted to the consideration of figures, that it can exercise the understanding only on condition of greatly fatiguing the imagination; and, in the latter, there is so complete a subjection to certain rules and formulas, that there results an art full of confusion and obscurity calculated to embarrass, instead of a science fitted to cultivate the mind. By these considerations I was induced to seek some other method which would comprise the advantages of the three and be exempt from their defects. And as a multitude of laws often only hampers justice, so that a state is best governed when, with few laws, these are rigidly administered; in like manner, instead of the great number of precepts of which logic is composed, I believed that the four following would prove perfectly sufficient for me, provided I took the firm and unwavering resolution never in a single instance to fail in observing them.\",\n",
       " u'The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgement than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.\\r\\rThe second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate solution.\\r\\rThe third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by little and little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more complex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects which in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and sequence.\\r\\rAnd the last, in every case to make enumerations so complete, and reviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.\\r\\rThe long chains of simple and easy reasonings by means of which geometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most difficult demonstrations, had led me to imagine that all things, to the knowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same way, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, provided only we abstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in our thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from another. And I had little difficulty in determining the objects with which it was necessary to commence, for I was already persuaded that it must be with the simplest and easiest to know, and, considering that of all those who have hitherto sought truth in the sciences, the mathematicians alone have been able to find any demonstrations, that is, any certain and evident reasons, I did not doubt but that such must have been the rule of their investigations. I resolved to commence, therefore, with the examination of the simplest objects, not anticipating, however, from this any other advantage than that to be found in accustoming my mind to the love and nourishment of truth, and to a distaste for all such reasonings as were unsound. But I had no intention on that account of attempting to master all the particular sciences commonly denominated mathematics: but observing that, however different their objects, they all agree in considering only the various relations or proportions subsisting among those objects, I thought it best for my purpose to consider these proportions in the most general form possible, without referring them to any objects in particular, except such as would most facilitate the knowledge of them, and without by any means restricting them to these, that afterwards I might thus be the better able to apply them to every other class of objects to which they are legitimately applicable. Perceiving further, that in order to understand these relations I should sometimes have to consider them one by one and sometimes only to bear them in mind, or embrace them in the aggregate, I thought that, in order the better to consider them individually, I should view them as subsisting between straight lines, than which I could find no objects more simple, or capable of being more distinctly represented to my imagination and senses; and on the other hand, that in order to retain them in the memory or embrace an aggregate of many, I should express them by certain characters the briefest possible. In this way I believed that I could borrow all that was best both in geometrical analysis and in algebra, and correct all the defects of the one by help of the other.\\r\\rAnd, in point of fact, the accurate observance of these few precepts gave me, I take the liberty of saying, such ease in unraveling all the questions embraced in these two sciences, that in the two or three months I devoted to their examination, not only did I reach solutions of questions I had formerly deemed exceedingly difficult but even as regards questions of the solution of which I continued ignorant, I was enabled, as it appeared to me, to determine the means whereby, and the extent to which a solution was possible; results attributable to the circumstance that I commenced with the simplest and most general truths, and that thus each truth discovered was a rule available in the discovery of subsequent ones Nor in this perhaps shall I appear too vain, if it be considered that, as the truth on any particular point is one whoever apprehends the truth, knows all that on that point can be known. The child, for example, who has been instructed in the elements of arithmetic, and has made a particular addition, according to rule, may be assured that he has found, with respect to the sum of the numbers before him, and that in this instance is within the reach of human genius. Now, in conclusion, the method which teaches adherence to the true order, and an exact enumeration of all the conditions of the thing .sought includes all that gives certitude to the rules of arithmetic.\\r\\rBut the chief ground of my satisfaction with thus method, was the assurance I had of thereby exercising my reason in all matters, if not with absolute perfection, at least with the greatest attainable by me: besides, I was conscious that by its use my mind was becoming gradually habituated to clearer and more distinct conceptions of its objects; and I hoped also, from not having restricted this method to any particular matter, to apply it to the difficulties of the other sciences, with not less success than to those of algebra. I should not, however, on this account have ventured at once on the examination of all the difficulties of the sciences which presented themselves to me, for this would have been contrary to the order prescribed in the method, but observing that the knowledge of such is dependent on principles borrowed from philosophy, in which I found nothing certain, I thought it necessary first of all to endeavor to establish its principles. .And because I observed, besides, that an inquiry of this kind was of all others of the greatest moment, and one in which precipitancy and anticipation in judgment were most to be dreaded, I thought that I ought not to approach it till I had reached a more mature age (being at that time but twenty-three), and had first of all employed much of my time in preparation for the work, as well by eradicating from my mind all the erroneous opinions I had up to that moment accepted, as by amassing variety of experience to afford materials for my reasonings, and by continually exercising myself in my chosen method with a view to increased skill in its application.',\n",
       " u'And finally, as it is not enough, before commencing to rebuild the house in which we live, that it be pulled down, and materials and builders provided, or that we engage in the work ourselves, according to a plan which we have beforehand carefully drawn out, but as it is likewise necessary that we be furnished with some other house in which we may live commodiously during the operations, so that I might not remain irresolute in my actions, while my reason compelled me to suspend my judgement, and that I might not be prevented from living thenceforward in the greatest possible felicity, I formed a provisory code of morals, composed of three or four maxims, with which I am desirous to make you acquainted.\\r\\rThe first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering firmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated from my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter according to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from extremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general consent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living. For as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought because I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced that I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of the most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the Persians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed to dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the opinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to me that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought rather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they said, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few disposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many are not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act of mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we know that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other. Also, amid many opinions held in equal repute, I chose always the most moderate, as much for the reason that these are always the most convenient for practice, and probably the best (for all excess is generally vicious), as that, in the event of my falling into error, I might be at less distance from the truth than if, having chosen one of the extremes, it should turn out to be the other which I ought to have adopted. And I placed in the class of extremes especially all promises by which somewhat of our freedom is abridged; not that I disapproved of the laws which, to provide against the instability of men of feeble resolution, when what is sought to be accomplished is some good, permit engagements by vows and contracts binding the parties to persevere in it, or even, for the security of commerce, sanction similar engagements where the purpose sought to be realized is indifferent: but because I did not find anything on earth which was wholly superior to change, and because, for myself in particular, I hoped gradually to perfect my judgments, and not to suffer them to deteriorate, I would have deemed it a grave sin against good sense, if, for the reason that I approved of something at a particular time, I therefore bound myself to hold it for good at a subsequent time, when perhaps it had ceased to be so, or I had ceased to esteem it such.\\r\\rMy second maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was able, and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinions, when once adopted, than if they had been highly certain; imitating in this the example of travelers who, when they have lost their way in a forest, ought not to wander from side to side, far less remain in one place, but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a line as possible, without changing their direction for slight reasons, although perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determined the selection; for in this way, if they do not exactly reach the point they desire, they will come at least in the end to some place that will probably be preferable to the middle of a forest. In the same way, since in action it frequently happens that no delay is permissible, it is very certain that, when it is not in our power to determine what is true, we ought to act according to what is most probable; and even although we should not remark a greater probability in one opinion than in another, we ought notwithstanding to choose one or the other, and afterwards consider it, in so far as it relates to practice, as no longer dubious, but manifestly true and certain, since the reason by which our choice has been determined is itself possessed of these qualities. This principle was sufficient thenceforward to rid me of all those repentings and pangs of remorse that usually disturb the consciences of such feeble and uncertain minds as, destitute of any clear and determinate principle of choice, allow themselves one day to adopt a course of action as the best, which they abandon the next, as the opposite.',\n",
       " u'My third maxim was to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than fortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and in general, accustom myself to the persuasion that, except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we have done our best in things external to us, all wherein we fail of success is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible: and this single principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring for the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me contented; for since our will naturally seeks those objects alone which the understanding represents as in some way possible of attainment, it is plain, that if we consider all external goods as equally beyond our power, we shall no more regret the absence of such goods as seem due to our birth, when deprived of them without any fault of ours, than our not possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico, and thus making, so to speak, a virtue of necessity, we shall no more desire health in disease, or freedom in imprisonment, than we now do bodies incorruptible as diamonds, or the wings of birds to fly with. But I confess there is need of prolonged discipline and frequently repeated meditation to accustom the mind to view all objects in this light; and I believe that in this chiefly consisted the secret of the power of such philosophers as in former times were enabled to rise superior to the influence of fortune, and, amid suffering and poverty, enjoy a happiness which their gods might have envied. For, occupied incessantly with the consideration of the limits prescribed to their power by nature, they became so entirely convinced that nothing was at their disposal except their own thoughts, that this conviction was of itself sufficient to prevent their entertaining any desire of other objects; and over their thoughts they acquired a sway so absolute, that they had some ground on this account for esteeming themselves more rich and more powerful, more free and more happy, than other men who, whatever be the favors heaped on them by nature and fortune, if destitute of this philosophy, can never command the realization of all their desires.\\r\\rIn fine, to conclude this code of morals, I thought of reviewing the different occupations of men in this life, with the view of making choice of the best. And, without wishing to offer any remarks on the employments of others, I may state that it was my conviction that I could not do better than continue in that in which I was engaged, viz., in devoting my whole life to the culture of my reason, and in making the greatest progress I was able in the knowledge of truth, on the principles of the method which I had prescribed to myself. This method, from the time I had begun to apply it, had been to me the source of satisfaction so intense as to lead me to, believe that more perfect or more innocent could not be enjoyed in this life; and as by its means I daily discovered truths that appeared to me of some importance, and of which other men were generally ignorant, the gratification thence arising so occupied my mind that I was wholly indifferent to every other object. Besides, the three preceding maxims were founded singly on the design of continuing the work of self- instruction. For since God has endowed each of us with some light of reason by which to distinguish truth from error, I could not have believed that I ought for a single moment to rest satisfied with the opinions of another, unless I had resolved to exercise my own judgment in examining these whenever I should be duly qualified for the task. Nor could I have proceeded on such opinions without scruple, had I supposed that I should thereby forfeit any advantage for attaining still more accurate, should such exist. And, in fine, I could not have restrained my desires, nor remained satisfied had I not followed a path in which I thought myself certain of attaining all the knowledge to the acquisition of which I was competent, as well as the largest amount of what is truly good which I could ever hope to secure Inasmuch as we neither seek nor shun any object except in so far as our understanding represents it as good or bad, all that is necessary to right action is right judgment, and to the best action the most correct judgment, that is, to the acquisition of all the virtues with all else that is truly valuable and within our reach; and the assurance of such an acquisition cannot fail to render us contented.',\n",
       " u'Having thus provided myself with these maxims, and having placed them in reserve along with the truths of faith, which have ever occupied the first place in my belief, I came to the conclusion that I might with freedom set about ridding myself of what remained of my opinions. And, inasmuch as I hoped to be better able successfully to accomplish this work by holding intercourse with mankind, than by remaining longer shut up in the retirement where these thoughts had occurred to me, I betook me again to traveling before the winter was well ended. And, during the nine subsequent years, I did nothing but roam from one place to another, desirous of being a spectator rather than an actor in the plays exhibited on the theater of the world; and, as I made it my business in each matter to reflect particularly upon what might fairly be doubted and prove a source of error, I gradually rooted out from my mind all the errors which had hitherto crept into it. Not that in this I imitated the sceptics who doubt only that they may doubt, and seek nothing beyond uncertainty itself; for, on the contrary, my design was singly to find ground of assurance, and cast aside the loose earth and sand, that I might reach the rock or the clay. In this, as appears to me, I was successful enough; for, since I endeavored to discover the falsehood or incertitude of the propositions I examined, not by feeble conjectures, but by clear and certain reasonings, I met with nothing so doubtful as not to yield some conclusion of adequate certainty, although this were merely the inference, that the matter in question contained nothing certain. And, just as in pulling down an old house, we usually reserve the ruins to contribute towards the erection, so, in destroying such of my opinions as I judged to be Ill-founded, I made a variety of observations and acquired an amount of experience of which I availed myself in the establishment of more certain. And further, I continued to exercise myself in the method I had prescribed; for, besides taking care in general to conduct all my thoughts according to its rules, I reserved some hours from time to time which I expressly devoted to the employment of the method in the solution of mathematical difficulties, or even in the solution likewise of some questions belonging to other sciences, but which, by my having detached them from such principles of these sciences as were of inadequate certainty, were rendered almost mathematical: the truth of this will be manifest from the numerous examples contained in this volume. And thus, without in appearance living otherwise than those who, with no other occupation than that of spending their lives agreeably and innocently, study to sever pleasure from vice, and who, that they may enjoy their leisure without ennui, have recourse to such pursuits as are honorable, I was nevertheless prosecuting my design, and making greater progress in the knowledge of truth, than I might, perhaps, have made had I been engaged in the perusal of books merely, or in holding converse with men of letters.\\r\\rThese nine years passed away, however, before I had come to any determinate judgment respecting the difficulties which form matter of dispute among the learned, or had commenced to seek the principles of any philosophy more certain than the vulgar. And the examples of many men of the highest genius, who had, in former times, engaged in this inquiry, but, as appeared to me, without success, led me to imagine it to be a work of so much difficulty, that I would not perhaps have ventured on it so soon had I not heard it currently rumored that I had already completed the inquiry. I know not what were the grounds of this opinion; and, if my conversation contributed in any measure to its rise, this must have happened rather from my having confessed my Ignorance with greater freedom than those are accustomed to do who have studied a little, and expounded perhaps, the reasons that led me to doubt of many of those things that by others are esteemed certain, than from my having boasted of any system of philosophy. But, as I am of a disposition that makes me unwilling to be esteemed different from what I really am, I thought it necessary to endeavor by all means to render myself worthy of the reputation accorded to me; and it is now exactly eight years since this desire constrained me to remove from all those places where interruption from any of my acquaintances was possible, and betake myself to this country, in which the long duration of the war has led to the establishment of such discipline, that the armies maintained seem to be of use only in enabling the inhabitants to enjoy more securely the blessings of peace and where, in the midst of a great crowd actively engaged in business, and more careful of their own affairs than curious about those of others, I have been enabled to live without being deprived of any of the conveniences to be had in the most populous cities, and yet as solitary and as retired as in the midst of the most remote deserts.',\n",
       " u'Nomination advanced out of committee on a party-line vote\\r\\r* Some Republican support needed for Watt\\'s final approval\\r\\r* Panel also approved other presidential nominees\\r\\rBy Margaret Chadbourn\\r\\rWASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee on Thursday backed Representative Mel Watt to be the next regulator of government-controlled mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sending the nomination to the full Senate where it faces an uncertain fate.\\r\\rPresident Barack Obama nominated Watt, a Democrat from North Carolina, to replace Edward DeMarco as head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency on May 1, but many Republicans were quick to make clear they would not support the nominee.\\r\\rMembers of the committee approved the choice 12-10 strictly along party lines, a sign of the trouble the nomination is likely to face in the full chamber, where some Republican support will likely be needed for Watt to win final approval.\\r\\r\"Congressman Mel Watt is well-qualified to lead the FHFA in its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and he too should be confirmed without delay,\" said the panel\\'s chairman, Democratic Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota.\\r\\rThe panel also approved Jason Furman to head Obama\\'s Council of Economic Advisers, and Michael Piwowar and Kara Stein to be members of the Securities and Exchange Committee. Richard Metsger, nominated to join the National Credit Union Administration Board, was approved as well. It also backed current SEC Chair Mary Jo White to serve a full term.\\r\\rIn contrast to Watt, who has served in the House for two decades, those nominees garnered Republican support. To win confirmation by the full Senate, the 67-year-old North Carolina lawmaker will likely have to win a super majority of 60 votes to overcome Republican procedural hurdles.\\r\\rDemocrats control the chamber, with the current breakdown at 52 Democrats, 46 Republicans, and two Independents, who both caucus with the Democrats.\\r\\rRepublicans who oppose Watt\\'s nomination contend he lacks the technical expertise needed to take on the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently back about half of existing U.S. home loans. Watt is a long-time member of the House Financial Services Committee, which has jurisdiction over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and a former head of the Congressional Black Caucus.\\r\\r\"The conservator must be an apolitical financial regulator with technical expertise,\" said Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the panel. He voiced skepticism that Watt had the skills needed to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mach and head the FHFA, a post that is \"like no other position in our government.\"\\r\\rIf Watt\\'s nomination does not clear the Senate, it would mark the Obama administration\\'s second failed attempt to win confirmation for a permanent FHFA director. DeMarco has been serving in an acting capacity since 2009, and Obama\\'s first attempt to fill the FHFA post met strong Republican opposition and the president\\'s nominee Joe Smith, then the North Carolina banking commissioner, eventually withdrew in 2011.\\r\\rFannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized by the government in 2008 as mortgage losses threatened their solvency. They were propped up with $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds, but have since returned to profitability and have paid about $132 billion to the U.S. Treasury in dividends for the government\\'s stake.\\r\\rDeMarco has faced push back from the Obama administration, Democrats, and housing and consumer advocates for blocking a proposal to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to write down principal on troubled loans that they back.\\r\\rAt his confirmation hearing on June 27, Watt signaled he would give strong consideration to such a proposal.\\r\\rIn addition to weighing in on the question of loan forgiveness, the next FHFA director would be expected to guide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through an overhaul to reduce their dominant role in the housing finance system.\\r\\rWatt has welcomed legislation unveiled by two members of the panel that would dismantle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over five years. The measure would still maintain a federal role in backstopping the mortgage market.\\r\\rIn addition to approving Watt, and favorably voting for the four other presidential nominees, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown said he has some outstanding concerns about the new SEC chair White and her prior ties to Wall Street during her days working as a defense attorney.\\r\\r\"I voted against Ms. White in March. At the time I said I hope she proves me wrong. Unfortunately at this point, I view her record as more negative than positive. She has not yet met the burden of proof to change my mind,\" said Brown.\\r\\rNot considered controversial, Piwowar, a Republican, and Stein, a Democrat, will replace outgoing SEC Commissioners Troy Paredes and Elisse Walter.\\r\\rUnlike Watt, all other of the nominations that cleared the banking committee are expected to sail through the Senate.',\n",

Profit from trading and investment banking was nearly six times higher than a year earlier, helped by stronger stock and bond trading, and profit for Morgan Stanley in wealth management jumped 83 percent.\\r\\rThe bank said regulators approved its buying back $500 million of its stock, and Morgan Stanley shares rose 5 percent in midday trading. The buybacks would represent the first time the bank has repurchased shares since the 2008 financial crisis.\\r\\rChief Executive James Gorman has been trying to fix Morgan Stanley, which suffered big losses during the crisis. He has been focusing on measures such as improving profitability in the bond trading business and the wealth management unit, which until June was a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.\\r\\r\"They\\'ve been talking about some of these plans for a long time but weren\\'t reaching the targets ... But now, they\\'re finally showing progress,\" said Shannon Stemm, an analyst with Edward Jones who covers Morgan Stanley.\\r\\rBut Gorman still has work to do. Morgan Stanley\\'s return on equity, a measure of how effectively the bank wrings profit from shareholders\\' money, was just 5.2 percent in the latest quarter. That is up from 3.7 percent a year earlier but less than half of what investors expect. Rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. investment bank, posted a return on equity of 10.5 percent for the second quarter.\\r\\rNet income attributable to common shareholders rose to $802 million, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter from $564 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier.\\r\\rExcluding special items, Morgan Stanley earned 45 cents per share, beating analysts\\' average estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\\r\\rThe latest results included a gain related to changes in the value of the bank\\'s own debt, largely offset by a charge from buying Citigroup\\'s remaining share of the wealth management business.\\r\\rRevenue rose 22 percent to $8.50 billion, while expenses rose 12 percent to $6.73 billion, signaling that the bank is keeping a lid on cost growth. Analysts usually look for banks\\' revenue growth to exceed cost growth.\\r\\rMorgan Stanley has achieved its targets for expenses, Ruth Porat, the bank\\'s chief financial officer, said in an interview with Reuters.\\r\\r\"But we are continuing to focus on expense reduction. There\\'s more to do,\" she added.\\r\\rMorgan Stanley is the last of the big five Wall Street banks to report second-quarter earnings.\\r\\rLike Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup, Morgan Stanley easily beat analysts\\' profit expectations, thanks largely to strength in trading and underwriting early in the quarter before bond yields spiked.\\r\\rHigher yields can cut into client demand to issue bonds, and can reduce trading volume if investors rush for the sidelines.\\r\\rMOVING PAST THE DOWNGRADE\\r\\rMorgan Stanley\\'s strategy for improving returns in its fixed-income business includes reducing assets there. Adjusting for risk, it had hoped to reduce those assets to less than $255 billion by the end of this year, but it reached that goal in the first quarter.\\r\\rAt the end of the second quarter, its risk-weighted assets in fixed-income trading were $239 billion, close to the bank\\'s goal of $235 billion by the end of 2014.\\r\\r\"We\\'re well ahead of our targets,\" Porat told Reuters.\\r\\rReducing assets in fixed-income trading will also help the bank meet leverage requirements under proposed new U.S. rules, Porat said on a conference call. The bank\\'s leverage ratio, which compares equity to assets, was about 4.2 percent at the end of the second quarter. The proposed requirement is 5 percent; Morgan Stanley believes it can meet that level by 2015.\\r\\rStock trading revenue jumped to $1.8 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier, excluding the debt valuation adjustment, or DVA, which reflects gains and losses on banks\\' own debt.\\r\\rRevenue from fixed income and commodities trading rose 50 percent to $1.15 billion, excluding DVA.\\r\\rLast year\\'s figures were hurt by a downgrade of the bank by Moody\\'s Investors Service in June. Anticipation of the downgrade during the quarter cut into Morgan Stanley\\'s bond trading revenue in particular.\\r\\rMorgan Stanley had set a quarterly revenue benchmark for fixed income and commodities trading revenue of $1.5 billion, saying this is necessary to meet its cost of capital following a disappointing first-quarter.\\r\\rAs with its rivals, underwriting was a bright spot in the second quarter. Debt underwriting revenue rose 24 percent to $418 million, while equity underwriting revenue increased 16 percent to $327 million.\\r\\rAdvisory revenue rose 27 percent to $333 million despite weak M&A activity.\\r\\rWealth management revenue rose 10 percent to $3.53 billion, representing a profit margin of 18.5 percent.\\r\\rGorman is targeting a profit margin of at least 20 percent for the wealth management business by 2015, and has said the margin could top 23 percent if interest rates rise and market conditions improve.',\n",

Also, wireless profit margins were hurt by higher costs.\\r\\rWhile analysts described the results as solid, they noted investors would have liked better news since Verizon shares had risen more than 17 percent since the end of 2012 in anticipation of strong growth prospects.\\r\\r\"The results were very good but at these valuations even very good might not be good enough,\" said Moffett Research analyst Craig Moffett.\\r\\rSome of Verizon\\'s strong valuation has been due to investor expectations it would be able to increase its earnings by buying out Vodafone Group Plc\\'s 45 percent stake in their Verizon Wireless venture.\\r\\rBut Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo did not address the matter during his earnings call. \"Their silence on the topic of buying in the Vodafone stake could be disappointing to some investors,\" Moffett said.\\r\\rIn an interview with Reuters, Shammo declined to comment on the prospects for a Vodafone deal.\\r\\rThe executive said about 60 percent of its decline in wireline revenue was due to shrinking government spending while the rest came from corporate spending cuts.

Verizon reported churn of 0.93 percent, compared with his expectations for 0.9 percent.\\r\\rVerizon may have lost some customers to No. 4 U.S. wireless provider T-Mobile US Inc, according to Moffett.

This year, however, the flow of radical policies has eased, giving investors some respite.\\r\\rNow markets are worried that Orban, who is seeking re-election next year, is preparing to resume his push on business after his government announced plans to modify contracts that borrowers signed with banks to secure foreign currency mortgages.\\r\\rThe Justice Ministry said borrowers should not be faulted for being unable to service debt for external reasons such as a deteriorating exchange rate.\\r\\r\"This is a very drastic potential step that they are considering,\" said Peter Attard Montalto of Nomura.\\r\\rHungary\\'s forint currency weakened one percent on Thursday, a fall traders said was linked to nervousness about the mortgage plan.

Opinion polls show Orban leads the opposition, but there are still many undecided voters and they will decide the outcome.\\r\\rQUICK DECISION\\r\\rMany of the mortgages in Hungary are owned by foreign banks such as Austria\\'s Raiffeisen, Belgium\\'s KBC and Italy\\'s Unicredit.\\r\\rLarge numbers of Hungarians - as elsewhere in central Europe - took out home loans in foreign currencies because the terms were better than forint mortgages. Since then, exchange rate moves have made the loans much more expensive, leading many people to fall behind in their repayments.\\r\\rOrban has spoken out in defence of borrowers, and talked about a need for investors who made huge profits in previous years to take their share of the burden.\\r\\rThe government\\'s new plans surfaced in the wake of a court ruling on the issue earlier this month, which disappointed many borrowers by finding the loan contract in question was valid.\\r\\rAfter the verdict, the ruling Fidesz party said the court was on the side of banks and described the decision as outrageous.\\r\\rBankers contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the government\\'s proposal.\\r\\rThe government appears to be in a rush to implement its new mortgage plan, about which nothing was known until Tuesday evening. The cabinet is planning to debate the proposals next week and legislation could go to parliament in the autumn session.\\r\\rThe government had said several times that it planned no further measures to help household borrowers.\\r\\rTimothy Ash of Standard Bank said the new scheme was a \"classic case of Orbanitis. i.e. policy made on the hoof. And just when Hungary was looking pretty good, with the government behaving in a very market friendly way.\"\\r\\rIt would not be the first time Orban\\'s government has intervened with foreign currency loans. In 2011, it imposed a scheme that allowed people to repay their loans early, but at an exchange rate more favourable for the borrowers. It has also implemented other schemes.\\r\\rThat contributed to the banking sector posting losses of 243 billion forints ($1.1 billion) and 161 billion forints in the past two years.\\r\\rHowever, many borrowers could not benefit from previous relief schemes. At the end of last year 19.3 percent of household foreign currency loans were non-performing, according to a June report by financial supervisor PSZAF.\\r\\rMargit Abonyi, is typical of the Hungarians still weighed down by foreign currency mortgages. Her daughter took out a loan in Swiss francs in 2007. That loan has now nearly doubled in size, because of exchange rate changes.\\r\\rThe bank terminated the loan contract in April after the family had been unable to pay instalments for a year. Abonyi had to agree with the bank to sell her daughter\\'s flat, and her own apartment which she had used to secure the loan.\\r\\r\"It would be great (if the government helped) but it may be too late for us,\" Abonyi told Reuters.

       " u' Hoping to gain the high ground in an escalating war of words over Obamacare, the U.S. administration on Thursday forecast sharply lower than expected insurance costs for consumers and small businesses in new online state healthcare exchanges.\\r\\rA report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said data from 10 states and the District of Columbia shows preliminary 2014 premiums on the lowest-cost mid-range \"silver\" plans in those marketplaces to be 18 percent lower on average than earlier administration and congressional estimates.\\r\\rRates for businesses with fewer than 50 employees that purchase small-group coverage through exchanges could also be 18 percent lower than what the same plans would cost without President Barack Obama\\'s landmark healthcare reform law, based on data from six states, HHS said.\\r\\rThe report was released in conjunction with a speech by Obama on how healthcare reform is already benefiting consumers. It represents the administration\\'s latest bid to counter Republican allegations that consumers and businesses will see sharply higher costs from the exchanges than the individual insurance plans already on the market.\\r\\rThe new exchanges are slated to begin enrolling as many as 7 million uninsured Americans for 2014 on Oct. 1 in federally subsidized health plans ranging in quality from platinum, with the highest premiums, to bronze, with the lowest.\\r\\r\"Today\\'s report shows that the Affordable Care Act is working to increase transparency and competition among health insurance plans and drive premiums down,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement accompanying the report.\\r\\rThe actual rates consumers see could be lower than current estimates, the HHS report concluded, saying that rate reviews and negotiations under way in the District of Columbia, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have already reduced prospective costs announced in the spring.\\r\\rBut it was not clear whether the lower rates contained in the report would be reflected nationwide. The report\\'s authors cautioned that some states could see costs closer to earlier projections.\\r\\rThe exchanges represent the centerpiece of Obama\\'s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and their success could depend on the cost of so-called silver plans, which are expected to attract the largest number of enrollees.\\r\\rThe events come a day after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives called in a symbolic vote for a delay of the reform law\\'s individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health coverage in 2014 or pay a penalty. The House measure is expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\\r\\rA leading insurance group, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, issued a statement late on Wednesday saying that such a delay, if enacted without other insurance market changes, would lead to skyrocketing costs for consumers.\\r\\rThe HHS report said prospective premiums in the 10 states studied appear to be affordable for younger adults, including men, whose participation is vital to the success of the exchanges and healthcare reform overall. Younger healthy people who tend to be cheaper to insure are needed to compensate for older and sicker consumers who are expected to enroll in droves.\\r\\rIn Los Angeles, which has the largest number of uninsured people in the country, HHS said the lowest-cost silver plan for a 25-year-old individual will cost $174 per month without subsidies and $34 per month for an individual whose income is $17,235. A catastrophic plan, which mainly covers major medical costs, will cost $117 per month for an individual.\\r\\rThe 10 states examined in the HHS report are California, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.',\n",

In consumer and small business banking, revenue fell by nearly 1 percent, while in consumer real estate services, revenue dropped 16 percent. In retail brokerage and asset management, investment banking and sales and trading, revenue rose.\\r\\rIn April, Moynihan said that with the bank getting expenses and bad assets under control, management would work more on boosting revenue and improving operations. \"As the other issues go away, this is what the team has to be focused on,\" he said.\\r\\rBank of America paid about $2.5 billion for mortgage lender Countrywide Financial in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, but since then it has paid and paid again for the company.

Ramos (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings in relief and Steve Cishek worked the ninth for his 13th save.\\rMinnesota dropped its third game in the last four.\\r''It wasn't our night,'' Twins manager Rod Gardenhire said. ''We left some pitches up in the zone late. Every time we did, they seemed to whack it. We also made three errors. You don't win too many games when you make three errors whether it costs you runs or not.''\\rMiami starter Jose Fernandez allowed one run and four hits in five innings. The 20-year-old phenom struck out three and walked three while throwing 94 pitches, 59 for strikes.\\r''He kept us in it,'' Redmond said. ''You think about a young kid who didn't really have his best stuff, but still was pretty impressive out there and made pitches when he absolutely needed to. That's the kind of guy he is.''\\rFernandez is 2-1 with a 1.67 ERA in five June starts.\\r''I wanted to keep pitching, but my stuff wasn't there today and I agree with the decision,'' Fernandez said.\\rMinnesota's Justin Morneau appeared to line into a double play to end the eighth, but first baseman Logan Morrison dropped the throw, allowing Joe Mauer to remain on base.

       " u\"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Rick Porcello kept up the starting pitching surge Detroit has been riding all season.\\rPrince Fielder came through with another clutch hit, and Jose Valverde even had a stress-free appearance to try to get back on track. This is the way the Tigers wanted to start the series in Minnesota.\\rFielder broke open a scoreless game with a two-run double in the sixth inning, the spark that Porcello and the Tigers used to beat the Twins 4-0 on Friday night.\\rDespite his status as the afterthought of this stacked rotation behind Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, Anibal Sanchez and Doug Fister, Porcello has shined in his last four appearances. He is 2-1 with 30 strikeouts in 27 innings and just 15 hits, five runs and four walks against him during that stretch.\\r''I've honestly really felt confident all year,'' Porcello said. ''I like what I've been working on, especially in the offseason going into spring training, and I'm starting to get some good results from it now.''\\rVictor Martinez and Jhonny Peralta followed Fielder's soaring drive with RBI doubles of their own, ending the night for Twins starter Scott Diamond (4-6). Even better for the Tigers was that the four-run cushion kept sputtering closer Jose Valverde out of a pressurized save situation.\\r''He wanted to be back out there tonight, and he wasn't shy about it,'' Tigers manager Jim Leyland said.\\rPorcello (4-3) didn't need much relief. The right-hander breezed through seven scoreless innings, allowing just two singles and one double without a walk. He struck out five and gave the Tigers their 19th quality start (of at least six innings and three runs or less) in the last 20 games.\\r''Porcello was unbelievable. The last couple starts, he's been doing great. The breaking ball and two-seamer he's throwing, it's awesome,'' Valverde said.\\rDiamond walked Austin Jackson, the leadoff man back in his familiar spot after he missed the last month because of a pulled left hamstring, with one out in that decisive sixth. Torii Hunter advanced Jackson with a groundout, and Miguel Cabrera was intentionally walked.\\r''Diamond matched him for a long time there,'' said Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, lamenting the leadoff walk: ''He got some balls up after that.''\\rFielder made the Twins pay.\\r''He's done a terrific job of picking us up in that situation when it's happened. Terrific job. Tonight, off a left-hander, that's really special,'' Leyland said.\\rWith one of those huge upper-cut swings, he smacked a 2-0 curveball high off the towering right-field wall to put the Tigers in front. Cabrera ran through the stop sign by third base coach Tom Brookens, whose arms were still straight up in the air as the big slugger chugged home without a throw.\\r''We're a team that slugs it pretty good, and when we slug it pretty good we look pretty good,'' Leyland said.\\rValverde came in for the ninth after Drew Smyly and Joaquin Benoit collaborated on a scoreless eighth. Valverde walked Joe Mauer to start the inning, but Ryan Doumit followed with a double-play ground ball. Josh Willingham was grazed by a pitch, but Justin Morneau struck out looking to end the game.\\r''It's great for me and great for my teammates to be on the mound and have my confidence again,'' said Valverde, who allowed 10 hits, seven runs and five homers over his last six appearances while blowing two of his five save opportunities.\\rValverde gave up a tying, two-run homer to Kansas City's Lorenzo Cain with two outs in the ninth inning on Wednesday, a game the Tigers lost in the 10th. Detroit's bullpen, the one glaring area of concern on this otherwise-championship-caliber club, has a 4-12 record with eight squandered saves in 22 chances.\\rLeyland bristled at a question about whether Valverde was still the closer, angrily lacing his answer with expletives before eventually affirming the veteran right-hander's status.\\r''We're going to use Jose Valverde until we decide Jose Valverde can or can't do it or we've got somebody else better,'' Leyland said.\\rThe skipper tried to suggest too much attention has been fixated on his relievers, noting the Tigers have had some recent trouble scoring. While losing two of three to the Royals they had seven runs in 28 innings. But the Tigers still have the best batting average in baseball, at .281 entering the night.\\rDiamond, who was replaced with two outs in the sixth, gave up five hits and two walks with just one strikeout. The six scoreless innings he pitched on June 2 fueled his lone victory of the last seven turns. That is also the only time in that span he finished six innings.\\rNOTES: Valverde was warming up on the field before the game, working on the split-fingered fastball that has been hit hard lately. ... Willingham, the regular in left field, was the DH for the Twins for the fourth straight time to rest his sore knees as much as possible. ... Sanchez (6-5, 2.65 ERA) will pitch for the Tigers on Saturday against RH Samuel Deduno (2-1, 3.47 ERA) of the Twins. Sanchez took a no-hitter one out into the ninth inning the last time he faced the Twins, in Detroit on May 24. He sat out his previous start because of tightness in his shoulder.\",\n",

''We go home happy.''\\rCleveland led 8-3 after five, but Minnesota scored four times in the final three innings.

''That's the bottom line. If I go out there and give up five runs and we win by one, we win by one.''\\rFor most of the night, it didn't look like such dramatics would be necessary. Michael Bourn had three hits and three RBIs and Corey Kluber won his third consecutive start. Cleveland took advantage of five first-inning walks to score six runs. Jason Kipnis added three hits to pace the Indians, who are 8-2 since losing eight in a row.\\rMinnesota starter P.J.

Kipnis and Bourn both had two-run singles while Jason Giambi and Drew Stubbs drew bases-loaded walks.\\rKluber (6-4) gave up three runs in 5 2-3 innings. The right-hander has allowed four earned runs in 21 2-3 innings in his last three starts.\\r''I wasn't as sharp as I'd like to be, but there are games when you go out there and hopefully get through it and give your team a chance to win,'' he said.\\rKluber ended the Indians' eight-game slide when he held Texas to one run in eight innings on June 11. He followed that with eight shutout innings against Washington on June 16. Kluber, who threw 100 pitches Saturday, gave up eight hits, struck out four and walked one. It appeared the game was under control when he was pulled but the Indians needed five relievers to finish the game.\\r''There were some highs and lows,'' Francona said of his bullpen's performance. ''Fortunately, the highs won out.''\\rMinnesota scored in the seventh and Parmelee homered to lead off the eighth, making it an 8-5 game. The Twins had the tying run at the plate with one out but Rich Hill struck out Mauer and Ryan Doumit.\\rJustin Morneau doubled to begin the ninth and scored on Oswaldo Arcia's ground ball for the second out of the inning.

''Anytime you get up near 30 pitches, that's a long inning.''\\rMauer hit a two-run homer in the first for Minnesota, which has homered in seven straight games. Arcia added a solo shot in the fourth.\\rWalters' problems began when he walked Bourn and hit Mike Aviles to start the first. Kipnis' double into the left corner tied the score. After Michael Brantley flied out, Carlos Santana and Mark Reynolds walked to load the bases. Walters then walked Giambi, who was batting .180, to force in a run.\\rLonnie Chisenhall flied out but a walk to Stubbs made it 4-2 and ended Walters' night. Bourn greeted Anthony Swarzak with single to center and Cleveland led 6-2. Walters threw 46 pitches, only 18 of which were strikes in two-thirds of an inning.

''It's too stressful.''\\rHe's in a much better place now.\\rKazmir continued his remarkable comeback story Friday night, pitching seven strong innings and Jason Kipnis drove in three runs, leading the Cleveland Indians to a 5-1 win over the Minnesota Twins on Friday night.\\rKazmir (4-4) gave up five hits, including a leadoff homer to Brian Dozier in the sixth. The left-hander, who has had expected ups and downs and entered the season winless since 2010, struck out seven, including five in his final two innings.\\rHe has been a pleasant addition for the Indians, who signed him during the winter after he pitched in the independent Atlantic League last season.\\r''I'm happy for him,'' Indians first baseman Mark Reynolds said. ''You know, being out of baseball, playing independent ball and finding his way back. It's just a great story. I've been really impressed with the way he's been able to throw strikes all year. He may get hit around a little bit, but he just keeps pounding the zone.''\\rKipnis hit a sacrifice fly - to the second baseman - off Samuel Deduno (3-2) in the third and added a two-run single in the seventh as the Indians won their third straight and seventh in nine games since losing eight in a row.\\rThe Twins came in riding a three-game winning streak.

Kazmir regrouped and struck out Joe Mauer, got Ryan Doumit on a grounder and fanned Josh Willingham looking to preserve the lead.\\rKazmir was in trouble in the seventh, when he appeared to hurt himself on a 3-1 pitch to Trevor Plouffe. Indians manager Terry Francona and trainer Lonnie Soloff quickly came to the mound to visit the starter, who told them ''I'm all right,'' but then gave up a double on his next pitch.\\rBut with Cody Allen warming up in the bullpen and Francona inching his way toward the dugout steps, Kazmir struck out Oswaldo Arcia and Clete Thomas to end the inning.\\rIt was a much-needed outing for Kazmir, who had felt good in his previous three starts but acknowledged trying to throw too hard got him in trouble. He's not where he was as a two-time All-Star with Tampa Bay (2006, 2008), but the 29-year-old believes he's getting back to his previous form.\\r''It's getting there,'' he said. ''I took a big step in the direction with this start.''\\rFrancona expected there would be some peaks and valleys for Kazmir, and during the pitcher's recent slide encouraged him to stay positive.\\r''If we thought he would get through the whole year without some hiccups, that's probably unrealistic,'' Francona said. ''This was more of the guy that we expect to see. He bounced back and pitched a really good game.''\\rThe Indians chased Deduno and added three runs in the seventh on Drew Stubbs' RBI single and Kipnis' blooper to left.\\rMark Reynolds singled and Deduno walked Lonnie Chisenhall before he was replaced by Josh Roenicke, who got one out but gave up Stubbs' run-scoring hit. Brian Duensing came on and got one out and walked Mike Aviles to load the bases before Kipnis dropped a soft single over shortstop Jamey Carroll's head to make it 5-1.\\rCleveland went up 2-0 in the third on a play scored as a rare sacrifice fly to second.\\rStubbs singled leading off and went to third on Michael Bourn's single. With one out, Kipnis hit a flair to shallow center that second baseman Dozier ran down and caught behind the bag, but dropped as he was transferring the ball from his glove. Stubbs alertly stayed on the base, tagged and dashed home.\\r''That was an unbelievable piece of base running,'' Francona said. ''He has no business scoring right there.

       " u\"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Twins flexed some muscle for their first three-game sweep of the season. The Chicago White Sox were easily overpowered in this lopsided series.\\rBrian Dozier's two-run homer was one of a career-high four long balls hit off John Danks, and the Twins beat the White Sox 8-4 on Thursday.\\r''It always helps a lot when you've got everybody hitting in the lineup,'' said Dozier, who homered for the third time in his last four games. ''Hopefully that won't let up, and we can continue the hot bats and the pitching and defense.''\\rOswaldo Arcia went deep in the second inning ahead of Dozier. Clete Thomas and Eduardo Escobar hit back-to-back shots in the fourth, sending the White Sox to their seventh defeat in the last eight games. They fell to a league-worst 13-28 on the road and 5-13 in June.\\r''The game is hard enough when you're not playing well,'' White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. ''When you're not playing well, you can see all the warts.''\\rDanks (1-4) lasted only five innings, giving up 12 hits and six runs. Paul Konerko and Adam Dunn hit consecutive home runs against Scott Diamond (5-6) in the sixth inning, but that wasn't nearly enough.\\rThe six combined homers on this humid, breezy afternoon matched a record at Target Field, which opened in 2010. The Twins last swept the White Sox in a three-game series Sept. 14-16, 2010, in Chicago. They'd never done it here before.\\r''You're only as good as your last game, but there's a confidence level,'' Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said.\\rThe White Sox dropped to 29-41, the first time they've been 12 games under .500 since the last day of the 2007 season, when they finished 72-90. That was the only year in the history of the AL Central, which was created in 1994, the White Sox have finished in fourth place. They've never finished last in the Central, but they're well on their way this summer, with starting pitching joining this week the list of problems topped by fielding and scoring.\\r''We truly feel like we're way too good to be playing like this,'' Danks said. ''We feel we're just as talented as any team in the league.''\\rThe signs of struggle were everywhere. Alejandro De Aza's drag bunt attempt in the fifth inning sailed about 20 feet in the air all the way to Dozier for an easy catch at second base. Then in the sixth, shortstop Alexei Ramirez let a soft two-out grounder get through his legs for an error. Two batters later, Justin Morneau's two-run single with the bases loaded stretched the lead to 8-4.\\rDanks, whose season started late because of surgery last summer on his left shoulder, fell to 0-4 in his four road starts with a 7.29 ERA. Nine of the 10 home runs he's allowed have been on the road.\\r''Home runs are exciting, but as long as we're putting them on the board you've got to be happy,'' Diamond said.\\rQuipped Gardenhire: ''As long as they're ours being hit into the seats, that's OK.''\\rDiamond won for only the second time in his last eight starts, with only one completion of six innings in that span. This turn, he lasted 5 1-3 innings with seven hits and four runs allowed. One of those was unearned, due to a throwing error by third baseman Trevor Plouffe in the fourth.\\rReliever Jesse Crain has been one bright spot for the White Sox, at least.\\rThe former Twins right-hander set Chicago's franchise record with his 28th consecutive scoreless appearance, passing J.J. Putz's mark from 2010. Crain, who has 37 strikeouts in 28 innings during the streak, has allowed only two runs all season, most recently on April 12.\\rNOTES: The six victories (out of nine) were the most on a homestand by the Twins since winning six of 12 here on from July 14-24, 2011. ... Ventura expressed encouragement about RHP Jake Peavy's first real exercise - riding the stationary bike - since he broke a rib two weeks. Peavy is expected to miss another two to four weeks. ...

       " u\"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Justin Morneau watched the ball sail off one of his big swings toward right field, and finally the flight ended in the seats.\\rAfter 168 at-bats without a home run, Minnesota's most powerful hitter for the past decade went deep again.\\rMorneau's two-run shot and Brian Dozier's three-run homer helped the Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 7-4 on Wednesday.\\r''They'll come in bunches. You'll see him at 20-plus before too long,'' Dozier said.\\rMorneau's third homer of the season followed an RBI single by Josh Willingham in the sixth off Deunte Heath after Chris Sale's night ended after five shaky innings. Morneau last went deep on April 28. The 2006 AL MVP has three seasons of 30-plus homers, but he hasn't done that since 2009.\\r''I was sure hoping it was going to be gone, that's for sure,'' Morneau said. ''It's been a while. It was good feeling. It was a good game for us. Hopefully that gets the monkey off my back, and we can get rolling.''\\rHis teammates teased him in the dugout after he rounded the bases, pretending to ignore him, a silent-treatment trick instigated by manager Ron Gardenhire, according to Dozier. So Morneau gave out a bunch of air high-fives, a light moment on a night when several Twins enjoyed fine performances.\\r''You can stand there and look like an idiot or high-five the air like an idiot. I chose to high-five the air like an idiot. It was fun,'' Morneau said.\\rGlen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for the second game in a row, recording his 18th save in 20 tries, after Kevin Correia (6-4) pitched into the seventh. Dozier reached base four times, including a three-run homer in the second against Sale (5-6).\\rThe White Sox have dropped six of seven to fall to 29-40. They're 11 games under .500 for the first time since an 11-22 record on May 6, 2011.\\r''We haven't quit. It's still a long way to go, and we can get hot any time,'' right fielder Alex Rios said. ''Any moment, we can turn things around. We're going to keep grinding until there's nothing left.''\\rIf Sale is struggling, that's almost a sure sign the White Sox are in trouble too. The lanky left-hander failed to reach the sixth inning for the first time in his last 10 starts, giving up four runs and eight hits. He also walked two, hit two batters and threw a wild pitch.\\rFour of Sale's five strikeouts were notched with his first four outs, but the second inning was a rough one. Oswaldo Arcia hit a sharp comebacker that Sale got a glove on to protect his body, but in doing so he jerked his midsection backward and flipped over from the momentum. The ball grazed his arm and his chin.\\rArcia had a one-out single, and Sale stayed in the game after he was checked out. Then Clete Thomas walked, and Dozier's two-out drive -- his fifth homer this season -- put the Twins in front 3-1.\\rRight before that, as Sale covered first base to barely get Pedro Florimon on a 3-1 groundout, the pitcher appeared to twist his left knee after trying to slow down and pivot toward the diamond as the runners moved to second and third. That prompted a second manager-trainer visit to Sale. He didn't show any discomfort after that, but he never found his form.\\rSale said neither of those scary plays affected his pitching.\\r''Getting behind guys, that's what happens. They make you pay for it,'' Sale said.\\rTrevor Plouffe's RBI single in the third inning extended the lead, and the Twins left eight men on base over Sale's five innings. Sale is 0-4 in four starts this month, but in 26 1-3 innings he has allowed only nine earned runs.\\rAlejandro De Aza's fourth leadoff home run this season was not nearly enough for the White Sox, who crept closer against the Twins bullpen but ran out of outs. Correia gave up five hits and two runs in 6 2-3 innings without a walk. He struck out six, after facing his third straight standout lefty. He had a no-decision against Washington's Gio Gonzalez and Philadelphia's Cliff Lee in his last two turns.\\r''I'm used to it. It's fun, going up against a very good pitcher like that. You don't have any room for error,'' Correia said.\\rNOTES: Morneau tied Kirby Puckett for fifth place on Minnesota's home run list with the 207th of his career. ... Twins first-round draft pick Kohl Stewart shagged fly balls during batting practice after signing his contract and will leave Thursday for Fort Myers, Fla., to start pitching in the Gulf Coast League. Stewart, also a star quarterback at St. Pius X High School in Houston, turned down an offer to play baseball and football for Texas A&M. When Stewart stepped on the plane for Minnesota this week, he noticed a familiar face sitting in front of him: Adrian Peterson. After they landed, Stewart used Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin as an introductory icebreaker. Sumlin was an assistant at Oklahoma when Peterson played there. ''It's kind of intimidating to introduce myself to Adrian Peterson, but it kind of worked out well,'' Stewart said.\",\n",
       " u\"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Another big hit from Ryan Doumit turned what could've been an ugly loss into a win for the Minnesota Twins.\\rDoumit hit a go-ahead double in the eighth inning, leading Minnesota over the Chicago White Sox 7-5 on Tuesday night.\\rJoe Mauer homered and Trevor Plouffe had an RBI single in Minnesota's four-run first inning off Dylan Axelrod.\\rAfter making baserunning mistakes, errors and throwing wild pitches while blowing the lead, Doumit's hit was very much needed.\\r''It's nice to be the guy who came up with the big hit,'' said Doumit, who also has delivered clutch hits in wins over Seattle and Washington this month. ''It's a nice little streak that I'm on, there's no doubt. I don't take anything for granted. Hopefully I can keep it going.''\\rThe White Sox came back to tie it at 5 in the eighth when Alex Rios worked a leadoff walk from reliever Jared Burton (1-4), stole second and scored on Paul Konerko's single that bounced off the pitcher's mound and into center field.\\rClete Thomas walked with two outs against Ramon Troncoso (0-2) in the eighth. Mauer followed with a single - his third hit of the game - and Doumit drove a double to left center that gave the Twins the lead.\\r''They had a mishap or two out there on the bases as well, a couple of wild pitches that let us get some people in scoring position,'' Konerko said. ''When you break it all down it was just the one hit there at the end that did it. Everything was even probably besides that. That was it right there.''\\rThe double was also Doumit's third hit of the game.\\rGlen Perkins pitched the ninth for his 17th save.\\rKonerko had four hits for Chicago, which has lost five of six and 13 of its last 15 on the road, and Conor Gillaspie had a two-run homer in the second off Twins starter Mike Pelfrey.\\rWith the White Sox in last place and struggling to score runs, questions are being asked about trading veterans and rebuilding the team. Konerko says, not so fast.\\r''I still think there's some good to come out of this at some point,'' Konerko said. ''It hasn't been right now, it hasn't been before now, but we still have good baseball in us. We just haven't shown it.''\\rComing off elbow surgery that wrecked his 2012 season, Pelfrey pitched into the seventh inning for his third straight start. He allowed four runs on 10 hits and left with runners on first and third with nobody out in the seventh.\\r''It stinks that I got spotted a four-run lead and slowly gave that back,'' Pelfrey said. ''Luckily, Doumit came up with a huge hit. Offense is always welcome.''\\rPedro Florimon added an RBI single for Minnesota.\\rAxelrod was pitching on seven days rest after allowing six runs in his previous start. After a rough beginning on Tuesday, he settled down and retired 11 of 12 batters at one point and allowed five runs - four earned - in six innings.\\r''Just kind of changed my approach. Threw a few more fastballs after the first inning'' Axelrod said. ''It was almost like they were kind of diving on me. Just changed it up and it worked out well. It's unfortunate what happened in the first.''\\rKonerko's four-hit game was his first since July 24 of last season and raised his batting average to .248.\\rMauer's homer barely cleared the left-field wall and was his first with runners on base since Sept. 1 of last season.\\rThe Twins had lost seven of their last 11 heading into Tuesday and were averaging fewer than three runs during the stretch.\\r''We kind of went silent after the first,'' Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. ''We just kind of hung on from there. Coming up late there is huge.''\\rNotes: Twins CF Aaron Hicks is running in the outfield and making progress rehabbing from a strained left hamstring.

On Sunday, he reached another career milestone with home run No. 300, this time at Target Field against the Twins as a member of the Tigers.\\rHunter added a double and drove in three runs for the Tigers, who beat Minnesota 5-2.\\rThe homer was Hunter's third this season and his first since hitting No. 299 against the Twins on May 26.\\r''It's special,'' Hunter said. ''I just wanted one. To get 300 home runs in the major leagues . this is a tough game to play.''\\rHunter provided plenty of support for Doug Fister (6-4), who held Minnesota hitless until the sixth inning.\\rThe right-hander didn't allow a baserunner until walking Ryan Doumit with two outs in the fourth inning, then lost his no-hit bid when Brian Dozier led off the sixth with a homer.\\rFister allowed two runs and two hits - both to Dozier - in 7 2-3 innings. He struck out seven, walked two and won for the first time in his last six starts.\\r''They hit a lot of balls hard,'' Fister said.

Regular Tigers closer Jose Valverde warmed up alongside Benoit in the eighth, though he pitched in a non-save situation on Friday and blew his last save opportunity Wednesday at Kansas City.\\r''Benoit had a little better repertoire for the hitters that were coming up for the Twins,'' Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. ''That's why I decided to stay with him.''\\rPressed on the decision, Leyland said he wasn't going to discuss the closer role, but noted Valverde is still in the ninth-inning mix.\\r''I felt like the best option to close the game was Benoit,'' Leyland said. ''That was today. I can't worry about anything other than winning games.''\\rDetroit jumped ahead early when Austin Jackson led off with a single and Hunter followed with his homer.\\r''He's killing me,'' a smiling Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. ''Not exactly happy when he does it against you, but I'm proud of him. He started in this organization and has had a heck of a career.\\r''You just tip your hat to him. One of the classiest guys in the game.''\\rJackson added a two-run homer of his own in the fourth inning, his first since April 28, giving him multiple hits in back-to-back games for the first time since mid-April.

       " u\"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Trevor Plouffe had been pushing for a while to get back into the Minnesota Twins lineup. The timing of his return turned out to be perfect against the Detroit Tigers.\\rPlouffe celebrated his 27th birthday on Saturday with three hits, including a two-run homer, in the Twins' 6-3 win over the Tigers.\\rIn his first game after missing 22 because of a concussion and left calf strain, Plouffe was a triple shy of the cycle.\\r''I like swinging up here,'' Plouffe said. ''It's good to be back. I've been itching to come back and be back with the boys, especially this series against the Tigers. It's a big series for us whenever we play them. I'm just happy to be back.''\\rWith Plouffe providing the offensive spark, Twins starter Samuel Deduno (3-1) won his third straight decision since being recalled in May. He has allowed only five earned runs in his last five starts.\\rDeduno gave up two runs and seven hits in seven innings. Glen Perkins added his 16th save in 18 chances.\\rPlouffe provided some long-awaited production from third base for Minnesota. Jamey Carroll and Eduardo Escobar had split time at third during Plouffe's absence and went 10 for 89 (.112) with no home runs.\\rPlouffe had returned from a concussion on May 30, and was scheduled to be in the starting lineup then, but he injured a calf before the game and went back on the disabled list.\\r''He stepped right back in there, and that's what they said down there,'' Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said of reports he received on Plouffe from his rehab assignment with Triple-A Rochester.\\rA first-round pick by the Twins in 2004, Plouffe has been plagued by injuries and inconsistency throughout his career. He started to show promise last year during a mid-summer power surge and finished with 24 home runs in 422 at-bats.\\rBut the injuries, especially to his legs, continued to nag him, which led to changing his warmup routine before Saturday's game. Plouffe said he has started a routine in which he rides an exercise bike for 10 minutes to warm up his legs.\\rPlouffe - who homered twice on his birthday last year - nearly homered a second time Saturday, but the ball hit high off the left-field fence, and he was thrown out at second base.\\r''One thing I didn't come back with is more speed, so I realized that pretty quick,'' Plouffe said.\\rAfter missing his previous start with shoulder stiffness, Anibal Sanchez struggled with pitch location and only lasted 3 2-3 innings for Detroit. Darin Downs (0-2) gave up three runs and five hits in relief of Sanchez, and took the loss.\\rSanchez was done two batters after Plouffe's homer, after he issued his season-high tying fourth walk. Sanchez was deemed healthy enough to pitch after he went 10 days between starts because of a troublesome shoulder.\\rSanchez and manager Jim Leyland said Sanchez was didn't have the usual velocity on his fastball.\\r''I feel good at this point,'' Sanchez said. ''Even right now I don't feel anything in my shoulder. Don't know for what reason I don't throw hard.''\\rAfter walking two batters to start the second, Sanchez was met on the mound by Leyland and Detroit's trainer. He stayed in the game, but walked two more batters.\\rThe homer by Plouffe was the first Sanchez allowed to a right-handed hitter this season. He has given up four home runs in seven starts after not allowing any in his first six.\\r''I wanted to be careful with Sanchez,'' Leyland said. ''I was a little concerned, that's why I went out early on, but the good news is he's healthy. He felt fine. Probably a little sluggish just trying to get his rhythm back and mechanics back.\\r''He'd been idle for a while. I was concerned originally but then yeah, I felt pretty comfortable, he was all right. He wasn't himself, obviously, but I didn't really expect him to be. I didn't want to push it too hard.''\\rMinnesota had its biggest offensive output since June 2, a span of 11 games, and Deduno made the runs stand up.\\rThe young right-hander, who starred in the World Baseball Classic for the Dominican Republic, gave up nine hits and six runs at Detroit in his first start of the season on May 24. He has allowed two runs or fewer in his last four starts and has helped solidify the Twins' trouble in the rotation.\\r''I got my confidence when I start, like working and pitching,'' Deduno said. ''When I get behind in the count, that was the problem. But when I'm throwing and get ahead of the count, everything is working like it did tonight.''\\rDeduno also escaped trouble with the help of key defensive plays behind him - two by Plouffe. Detroit had two runners thrown out at the plate, one by shortstop Pedro Florimon in the third and one by right-fielder Chris Parmelee in the sixth.\\rNOTES: Minnesota sent OF Wilkin Ramirez, on the disabled list with a concussion, to its facilities in Florida on Saturday to start doing baseball work. Twins general manager Terry Ryan said Ramirez could start a rehab assignment with the Fort Myers Miracle next week if all goes well. ... Peralta has a nine-game hitting streak against the Twins. He has hit safely in 45 of his last 55 games and owns a .333 batting average, third best in the American League ... P.J. Walters (2-1, 2.49) will start on Sunday for the Twins. Walters, called up on May 24, has allowed one earned run over his last two starts in 13 1-3 innings. He will be making his fifth major league start of the season. Detroit will counter with Doug Fister (5-4, 3.28 ERA). Fister has gone at least eight innings and allowed three runs in each of his last two outings, but lost both.

       " u'The Senate Banking Committee on Thursday backed Representative Mel Watt to be the next regulator of government-controlled mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sending the nomination to the full Senate where it faces an uncertain fate.\\r\\rPresident Barack Obama nominated Watt, a Democrat from North Carolina, to replace Edward DeMarco as head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency on May 1, but many Republicans were quick to make clear they would not support the nominee.\\r\\rMembers of the committee approved the choice 12-10 strictly along party lines, a sign of the trouble the nomination is likely to face in the full chamber, where some Republican support will likely be needed for Watt to win final approval.\\r\\r\"Congressman Mel Watt is well-qualified to lead the FHFA in its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and he too should be confirmed without delay,\" said the panel\\'s chairman, Democratic Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota.\\r\\rThe panel also approved Jason Furman to head Obama\\'s Council of Economic Advisers, and Michael Piwowar and Kara Stein to be members of the Securities and Exchange Committee. Richard Metsger, nominated to join the National Credit Union Administration Board, was approved as well. It also backed current SEC Chair Mary Jo White to serve a full term.\\r\\rIn contrast to Watt, who has served in the House for two decades, those nominees garnered Republican support. To win confirmation by the full Senate, the 67-year-old North Carolina lawmaker will likely have to win a super majority of 60 votes to overcome Republican procedural hurdles.\\r\\rDemocrats control the chamber, with the current breakdown at 52 Democrats, 46 Republicans, and two Independents, who both caucus with the Democrats.\\r\\rRepublicans who oppose Watt\\'s nomination contend he lacks the technical expertise needed to take on the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently back about half of existing U.S. home loans. Watt is a long-time member of the House Financial Services Committee, which has jurisdiction over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and a former head of the Congressional Black Caucus.\\r\\r\"The conservator must be an apolitical financial regulator with technical expertise,\" said Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the panel. He voiced skepticism that Watt had the skills needed to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mach and head the FHFA, a post that is \"like no other position in our government.\"\\r\\rIf Watt\\'s nomination does not clear the Senate, it would mark the Obama administration\\'s second failed attempt to win confirmation for a permanent FHFA director. DeMarco has been serving in an acting capacity since 2009, and Obama\\'s first attempt to fill the FHFA post met strong Republican opposition and the president\\'s nominee Joe Smith, then the North Carolina banking commissioner, eventually withdrew in 2011.\\r\\rFannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized by the government in 2008 as mortgage losses threatened their solvency. They were propped up with $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds, but have since returned to profitability and have paid about $132 billion to the U.S. Treasury in dividends for the government\\'s stake.\\r\\rDeMarco has faced push back from the Obama administration, Democrats, and housing and consumer advocates for blocking a proposal to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to write down principal on troubled loans that they back.\\r\\rAt his confirmation hearing on June 27, Watt signaled he would give strong consideration to such a proposal.\\r\\rIn addition to weighing in on the question of loan forgiveness, the next FHFA director would be expected to guide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through an overhaul to reduce their dominant role in the housing finance system.\\r\\rWatt has welcomed legislation unveiled by two members of the panel that would dismantle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over five years. The measure would still maintain a federal role in backstopping the mortgage market.\\r\\rIn addition to approving Watt, and favorably voting for the four other presidential nominees, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown said he has some outstanding concerns about the new SEC chair White and her prior ties to Wall Street during her days working as a defense attorney.\\r\\r\"I voted against Ms. White in March. At the time I said I hope she proves me wrong. Unfortunately at this point, I view her record as more negative than positive. She has not yet met the burden of proof to change my mind,\" said Brown.\\r\\rNot considered controversial, Piwowar, a Republican, and Stein, a Democrat, will replace outgoing SEC Commissioners Troy Paredes and Elisse Walter.\\r\\rUnlike Watt, all other of the nominations that cleared the banking committee are expected to sail through the Senate.',\n",

       " u'Hoping to gain the high ground in an escalating war of words over Obamacare, the U.S. administration on Thursday forecast sharply lower than expected insurance costs for consumers and small businesses in new online state healthcare exchanges.\\r\\rA report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said data from 10 states and the District of Columbia shows preliminary 2014 premiums on the lowest-cost mid-range \"silver\" plans in those marketplaces to be 18 percent lower on average than earlier administration and congressional estimates.\\r\\rRates for businesses with fewer than 50 employees that purchase small-group coverage through exchanges could also be 18 percent lower than what the same plans would cost without President Barack Obama\\'s landmark healthcare reform law, based on data from six states, HHS said.\\r\\rThe report was released in conjunction with a speech by Obama on how healthcare reform is already benefiting consumers. It represents the administration\\'s latest bid to counter Republican allegations that consumers and businesses will see sharply higher costs from the exchanges than the individual insurance plans already on the market.\\r\\rThe new exchanges are slated to begin enrolling as many as 7 million uninsured Americans for 2014 on Oct. 1 in federally subsidized health plans ranging in quality from platinum, with the highest premiums, to bronze, with the lowest.\\r\\r\"Today\\'s report shows that the Affordable Care Act is working to increase transparency and competition among health insurance plans and drive premiums down,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement accompanying the report.\\r\\rThe actual rates consumers see could be lower than current estimates, the HHS report concluded, saying that rate reviews and negotiations under way in the District of Columbia, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have already reduced prospective costs announced in the spring.\\r\\rBut it was not clear whether the lower rates contained in the report would be reflected nationwide. The report\\'s authors cautioned that some states could see costs closer to earlier projections.\\r\\rThe exchanges represent the centerpiece of Obama\\'s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and their success could depend on the cost of so-called silver plans, which are expected to attract the largest number of enrollees.\\r\\rThe events come a day after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives called in a symbolic vote for a delay of the reform law\\'s individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health coverage in 2014 or pay a penalty. The House measure is expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\\r\\rA leading insurance group, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, issued a statement late on Wednesday saying that such a delay, if enacted without other insurance market changes, would lead to skyrocketing costs for consumers.\\r\\rThe HHS report said prospective premiums in the 10 states studied appear to be affordable for younger adults, including men, whose participation is vital to the success of the exchanges and healthcare reform overall. Younger healthy people who tend to be cheaper to insure are needed to compensate for older and sicker consumers who are expected to enroll in droves.\\r\\rIn Los Angeles, which has the largest number of uninsured people in the country, HHS said the lowest-cost silver plan for a 25-year-old individual will cost $174 per month without subsidies and $34 per month for an individual whose income is $17,235. A catastrophic plan, which mainly covers major medical costs, will cost $117 per month for an individual.\\r\\rThe 10 states examined in the HHS report are California, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.',\n",

He lit his torch, and a flash-fire erupted. His hair and clothing disintegrated instantly.\\r\\rMoynihan, a contractor for the craft brewery, dragged himself up the tube and out of the vat while still on fire, suffering serious burns over much of his body. He died 75 days after the 2009 accident, just before his 40th birthday, said his widow, Kim Moynihan.\\r\\rIt was not an isolated incident.\\r\\rFrom 2009 through 2012, at least four people died in craft brewery accidents in the United States, compared with two deaths at large breweries that make 10 times more beer, according to a Reuters analysis of federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration data and local media reports.\\r\\rThere were also nearly four times as many safety violations at craft breweries in recent years than at large breweries. And brewery experts say the safety oversight at smaller companies is worse than official statistics might suggest because injuries, even severe ones, often go unreported.\\r\\r\"It was horrific,\" Kim Moynihan said. \"It was an accident, but it was an avoidable accident.\"\\r\\rShe sued Copper Cellar, claiming the owner of the brewery and a small chain of Calhoun\\'s restaurants in the Knoxville area created a dangerous work environment, according to court documents. She settled for an undisclosed amount but said she could not discuss the settlement further because of a nondisclosure agreement.\\r\\rNicholas J. Chase, a lawyer at Egerton, McAfee, Armistead & Davis representing Copper Cellar, said neither he nor his client could comment on the accident because the agreement might prohibit it. He said he was unable to immediately provide further details of the agreement.\\r\\rOVERLOOKED SAFETY\\r\\rThe craft brewing industry has grown from a niche market 20 years ago into a $10.2 billion business in 2012, according to the Boulder, Colorado-based Brewers Association, which represents 1,797 U.S. craft and larger beer makers. The association is not aware of safety issues unique to the craft brewing industry, Chris Swersey, its technical brewing projects coordinator, said in an email to Reuters.\\r\\rMatt Stinchfield, a brewery safety consultant for insurance companies, said that as the industry scrambles to meet the exploding demand for craft beer, employee safety has sometimes been overlooked. \"You have a few eager entrepreneurial spirits, and they don\\'t come with an industrial safety background,\" he said. \"There is still some growing up to do.\"\\r\\rBrewers Association board member Gary Fish said craft brewers sometime struggled with safety, as many other small manufacturers do.\\r\\rHaste causes accidents, and pressure to meet demand causes haste, said Fish, who is the founder and CEO of Deschutes Brewery in Bend, Oregon. \"It\\'s a challenge everywhere,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think anyone is deemphasizing safety.\"\\r\\rState inspectors and OSHA found 547 violations, including 250 serious ones, at craft breweries from 2003 through 2011, according Reuters\\' analysis of the data. Officials fined the small brewers an aggregate $220,000 for violations ranging from failing to enclose sprockets and chains to not ensuring machinery was disabled when an employee was inside.\\r\\rBy comparison, large brewers, such as Anheuser-Busch and Coors, had 151 violations, including 69 serious ones, during the same period.\\r\\rOSHA officials declined to comment.\\r\\rThe Brewers Association defines a craft brewery as one that makes 6 million barrels of beer a year or less, with less than 25 percent of the company owned by an alcoholic drink maker that is not a craft brewer. Traditional recipes are also required.\\r\\rTo be sure, the differences in fatality and violation figures partly reflect the larger breweries\\' greater automation and resources to spend on safety programs, as well as - in many cases - their more extensive experience.\\r\\rSafety experts say the workplace fatalities are avoidable.\\r\\rLast year, for example, an employee of Redhook Brewery in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, died when a keg he was cleaning with compressed air exploded and hit him. An OSHA investigation found the air line lacked a device that would keep the pressure in the keg at safe levels. The brewery\\'s owner, the Craft Brew Alliance, was fined $44,000 for that and a series of other safety violations.\\r\\rSebastian Pastore, vice president of operations for the Craft Brew Alliance, said the incident was a \"freak accident\" involving a plastic keg dropped off by a customer to be refilled.\\r\\rThe company subsequently re-examined safety issues at the brewery. It has stopped filling plastic kegs and hired an outside consultant to review safety procedures at its breweries. It now has a dedicated safety consultant for the Portsmouth brewery.\\r\\rFEW INJURIES REPORTED\\r\\rDespite the number of violations and deaths, OSHA data only shows two serious injuries at craft breweries since 2002, both at the same one. Two workers were burned in separate incidents at Ballast Point Brewing Co in San Diego in July 2010 and August 2010.\\r\\rSince then, the company has not had one hospitalized injury despite a fivefold increase in production and employees, said Chief Financial Officer Rick Morgan.\\r\\rThe number of injuries reported to OSHA does not reflect the number of injured employees, consultant Stinchfield said. This is because brewers often do not know that many states require them to report serious injuries.\\r\\rHe knows of four burn cases that were never reported. Each required skin grafts and months of treatment.\\r\\rIn one of those cases, Teri Fahrendorf was working her first job as a rookie brewmaster at a now-closed San Francisco brewery in 1989 when she used a kettle that was too small to cook wort, a pre-beer solution.\\r\\rThe boiling wort spilled out of the kettle and into Fahrendorf\\'s knee-high rubber boots. Doctors took strips of skin from her head to graft onto her foot, she said.\\r\\rNow Fahrendorf promotes safety standards in the industry as founder and president of the Pink Boots Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping women succeed in brewing. Fahrendorf said the brewery did not report the incident, and it does not appear in OSHA data.\\r\\rShe said she had lacked promised safety and other training. Craft breweries, she said, \"don\\'t have experience with big-boy chemicals, and they don\\'t have experience with pots that are filled with 900 gallons of boiling liquid.\"\\r\\rTANK EXPLOSION\\r\\rBridgewater, Vermont-based Long Trail Brewing Co and its Otter Creek Brewing subsidiary are two of only three U.S. craft brewers participating in a stringent OSHA safety program.\\r\\rThey joined the program, investing millions of dollars in upgrading equipment, developing safety policies and hiring a safety officer, after a 2011 fermentation tank explosion.\\r\\rThe blast did not injure anyone, but was a wake-up call, said Jed Nelson, a Long Trail Brewing Co director.\\r\\rThere are signs of a shift in the industry\\'s attitudes, said Dan Drown, an industrial chemical safety consultant who has been working with craft brewers in San Diego for the last five years.\\r\\rAt least 250 people attended a safety lecture at a craft brewing conference in San Diego last year, he said. More companies also are paying for safety training and classes.\\r\\r\"They are maturing,\" he said.\\r\\rThe widow, Kim Moynihan, hopes that is true.\\r\\r\"I know it was an accident, but I believe if the employees received proper training, this would not have happened,\" she said. \"I think they just overlook it.\"',\n",

Extensions and add-ons - which can multiply the size of a deal several times over - are now banned, and a contract limit of 100 million pounds has been introduced, although Crothers conceded this was more a \"direction\" than an edict.\\r\\rBritain\\'s competition watchdog is to examine whether government\\'s biggest IT providers like HP (HPQ.N) and CapGemini (CAPP.PA) as well as Capita win too great a share of public contracts.\\r\\rAnd government officials are examining outsourcing firms\\' profit margins, comparing public and private sector work to ensure they are in line, said Crothers, a former consultant at U.S.-listed outsourcing and consulting group Accenture (ACN.N).\\r\\r\"If we can see that another market in the UK, a company\\'s private sector clients, are paying a lower price or yielding a lower margin than we are, then something\\'s not right.\"\\r\\rSMEs are also taking action to increase their chances of winning contracts. Acknowledging the size and experience of the big firms, many of them are scaling up to compete.\\r\\rIT firm Invenio already competes with and often wins against major IT firms in the private sector. After three years of not winning public sector business the company, which builds tax management software, partnered up with a major government supplier that they declined to name. Invenio is now in advanced discussions to provide its software to HMRC, in what would be its first UK public sector deal, and hopes to win more.\\r\\r\"SMEs can provide so many things but are never considered seriously,\" Invenio managing director Partho Bhattacharya said. \"I think we are seeing the start of a change. When an SME wins business against a big company they have something special to offer and someone takes the risk and can see that special thing.\"\\r\\rDavid Ascott, a corporate finance partner at Grant Thornton who focuses on business services and private equity, forecast the strongest pickup in activity among mid-sized firms providing services like security and cleaning.\\r\\r\"Structurally it\\'s an unusual industry because you\\'ve got lots of big guys then not a lot in the middle. There\\'s probably more consolidation to come in that segment of the market - the creation of another one or two larger players rather than big ones buying them,\" he said.\\r\\rUPHILL BATTLE\\r\\rOne fact is incontestable: both large and small outsourcing firms will be fighting over less money. The UK faces the deepest budget cuts in Europe over the next decade, according to the OECD, so cuts to local government budgets will likely continue.\\r\\rThat will probably make it even harder to persuade embattled local governments and departments to have faith in smaller, untested firms.\\r\\rContracts handed to SMEs can go awry, like a 90-million pound Ministry of Justice contract in 2011, which resulted in court translators failing to turn up and others mistranslating hearings to defendants.\\r\\rThe Ministry of Justice has since announced a tender process that favors bigger firms - 500 million pounds of probation services contracts in 21 regional chunks, with the idea that prime providers then subcontract.\\r\\rAnd, as ever, the bigger firms will be able to bargain harder.\\r\\r\"(Capita) has got massive infrastructure,\" said Aldridge. \"The economies of scale they\\'ve got from this is enormous. The margins that Capita gets come not from bidding for higher margin but from having the infrastructure.\"',\n",

The share of business owners reporting few or no qualified applicants for job openings was 41 percent.\\r\\rSmall business hiring has been sluggish. There has been speculation that the Affordable Care Act, which compels employers with a staff complement of at least 50, was making some small business owners reluctant to add workers.\\r\\rThe Obama administration on Tuesday delayed the employer mandate of the legislation until 2015.\\r\\rEconomists at UBS in New York reckon the one-year delay could prompt small business owners to hire more workers.\\r\\r\"For those employers on the cusp of the 50 employee threshold this delay may prompt them to hire as they may be unwilling to continue to postpone hiring to avoid being subject to the mandate,\" UBS said in a research note.',\n",
       " u'A British website which allows members of the public to buy stakes in small businesses is planning to expand worldwide, aiming to create a global platform linking investors to firms in need of funds.\\r\\rAs banks rein in lending due to tougher capital rules and greater regulatory scrutiny, crowdfunding, which originated in the United States as a way to raise money for creative projects, has expanded rapidly as an alternative source of finance.\\r\\r\"The ultimate aim is to build a network of crowdfunding sites in 25 to 30 countries ... so the whole thing becomes a global investment platform,\" said Darren Westlake, chief executive and co-founder of Crowdcube, which says it is the world\\'s largest equity crowdfunding site.\\r\\r\"How does crowdfunding succeed? The best way is to build the biggest crowd, and how do you build the biggest crowd? You do it on a global basis,\" said Westlake.\\r\\rWestlake said Crowdcube, through which businesses have raised 9.3 million pounds ($14.1 million) since it launched in 2010, was working on several joint ventures following strong demand from others looking to set up similar sites.\\r\\rIt has launched in Sweden and Crowdcube Brazil should be up and running in the next six weeks, followed by Crowdcube Middle East in the Autumn.

       " u'Institutional investors are tripping over themselves to buy so-called peer-to-peer loans offered by a new breed of Internet lending companies, a development that could transform the nascent sector into significant player in the credit markets.\\r\\rP2P lending, as it is known, started in 2006 with the founding of Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace. Back then, the idea was to match individual borrowers with small investors looking to lend as little as $25.\\r\\rThe loans often have interest rates low enough to make them a feasible way for individuals to pay off high-cost credit card debt, yet the returns to investors are attractive compared to many other fixed-income assets.\\r\\rThese developments have caught the eye of hedge funds, endowments, pension funds and even banks and insurers who want to put hundreds of millions of dollars to work.\\r\\rThe influx of institutional money is enabling online lenders, led by Lending Club and Prosper, to offer far more loans and compete more directly with traditional banks. Loan originations are growing at about 300 percent a year, according to the two market leaders.\\r\\rBut the arrival of Wall Street investors also brings new risks for the sector. Sharp changes in interest rates or another economic slump could prompt the new money to depart as quickly as it arrived. And questions remain about the way the peer-to-peer lending industry vets borrowers and whether interest rates on the loans properly reflect the risk.\\r\\r\"The industry says it\\'s more efficient and it uses technology to underwrite better. That\\'s all a bunch of crap,\" said Mike Cagney, a credit market veteran and founder of SoFi, an Internet lending platform focused on student loans. \"Peer-to-peer lending in its current form hasn\\'t really gone through a full credit crisis.\"\\r\\rLending Club and Prosper do not lend money directly. Instead, borrowers fill out loan applications and post requests on their websites. Investors commit to fund the loans, then Utah-based bank WebBank makes the loans, sells them to Lending Club and Prosper, which in turn sell them on to the investors in the form of a note. The companies make money from servicing and origination fees.\\r\\rThe industry is on course to make about $3 billion in loans this year. But the market opportunity is about $85 billion, based on the most creditworthy borrowers currently served by the credit card industry, Prosper executive Ron Suber told a packed crowd at the industry\\'s first conference, LendIt, last month.\\r\\rGoogle Inc took a $125 million stake in Lending Club in May, valuing the company at more than $1.5 billion. An initial public offering is planned next year, according to Lending Club Chief Executive Renaud Laplanche.\\r\\r\\'ATTRACTIVE YIELD\\'\\r\\rP2P loans have annual interest rates ranging from 6 percent to as much as 30 percent, higher than many other fixed-income assets. The loans are typically repaid after just over a year.\\r\\r\"Attractive yield and short duration. In a yield-starved world, it\\'s very interesting,\" said Jason Jones of private investment firm Disruption Credit, which is starting a fund to buy and possibly securitize P2P loans.\\r\\rOther investment funds that are jumping into the business include HCG Funds, which recently launched a $10 million fund for Lending Club loans; Colchis Capital, which has more than $200 million allocated to P2P loan investing; and Eaglewood Capital Management and Arcadia Funds.\\r\\rA new Internet lending site, CircleBack Lending, will launch this month with an exclusive focus on institutions and ultra-wealthy investors, according to co-founder Michael Solomon.\\r\\rSome institutional loan buyers employ leverage - borrowing money at a lower interest rate and then re-lending it to the online borrowers.\\r\\rDisruption Credit, according to Jones, is planning to raise a $75 million fund to invest in P2P loans, and will then borrow another $425 million so it can buy $500 million worth of loans.\\r\\rEaglewood, which has put about $80 million to work in P2P lending so far, can leverage its fund 3 to 1, depending on the risk of the loans and other criteria.\\r\\rBut counting on money from leveraged hedge funds could leave the industry suddenly starved of funds to lend in the event that rising interest rates, a slumping economy or unexpectedly high rates of default were to suddenly send that money elsewhere.\\r\\rThe credit risk is hardly academic: loans originated by Prosper from November 2005 to June 2009 had a yield of just over 12 percent through the end of 2012. But losses from loan defaults reached almost 18 percent, leaving investors down 5.36 percent overall.\\r\\rProsper now sets interest rates on loans itself, based on the creditworthiness of borrowers, a big change from letting borrowers and lenders negotiate rates and an approach it says that has helped the company attract institutional investors.\\r\\rStill, the challenges of relying on leveraged investors remain for Lending Club, Prosper and new rivals like CircleBack.\\r\\r\"If any P2P platform becomes overly reliant on hedge funds or similar capital that is sensitive to markets and could be quickly removed, a major market shakeout could cut demand for their loans,\" said Jose Penabad of HCG Funds.\\r\\rHedge funds represent less than 10 percent of funding for loans on Lending Club and only half of them use leverage, according to CEO Laplanche. Lending Club has been working to attract more stable sources of institutional funding such as corporate pension plans and community banks, he said.\\r\\rAnd Lending Club has sought to prevent too much hedge fund money from flooding the market.\\r\\rColchis tried to launch a leveraged P2P loan fund earlier this year, but Lending Club did not allow it because the platform is not originating enough loans to meet the demand that would have been created by such an investment vehicle, according to a Colchis investor who did not want to be identified.\\r\\rA Colchis representative declined to comment. Lending Club\\'s Laplanche confirmed that there is no leveraged Colchis fund but declined further comment.\\r\\rSECURITIZATION LOOMS\\r\\rSome of the new P2P investors hope to employ yet another Wall Street tactic to boost returns: securitizing the loans by slicing them up into pieces for sale.\\r\\rDisruption Credit, for one, plans to securitize its loan assets in the future, dividing them into different tranches that can be bought and possibly traded by institutions such as pension funds and insurers.\\r\\rCagney said SoFi is planning the first securitization of its P2P student loans in September, with ratings from the credit rating agency DBRS and underwriting by banks including Barclays.\\r\\rSecuritization will provide another source of capital to fuel further growth in originations. But it also exposes the industry to even greater interest rate risk.\\r\\rIf yields on other types of debt jump as firms are preparing to securitize a pool of P2P loans, that could imperil the effort by making the offering less attractive to investors.\\r\\rJunk bond yields have surged from less than 5 percent to almost 7 percent in recent months. That makes P2P loans relatively less attractive to investors, said Cagney.\\r\\rIf rates keep climbing, SoFi may have to wait to do its securitization, he added.\\r\\rMeanwhile, SoFi\\'s loans are being financed by banks including Morgan Stanley.\\r\\r\"We could afford to wait a few months,\" Cagney added.',\n",
       " u'U.S. strip mall owners struggled with a lack of demand in the second quarter, although limited construction of new space led to a modest improvement in vacancy rates and slightly higher rents, according to a report released on Wednesday.\\r\\rThe national vacancy rate dropped to 10.5 percent last quarter from 10.6 percent the previous period, according to the report by real estate research firm Reis Inc. It was the sixth time in the last seven quarters that the rate dropped by one-tenth of a percent, with declines driven largely by a dearth of new construction.\\r\\rThe average asking and effective rents both rose 0.3 percent, as demand just barely exceeded the 914,000 square feet of new space made available.\\r\\r\"People look at the market and say: \\'These buildings are sitting 10 percent vacant or so, why are we going to build something new?\\'\" said Ryan Severino, a senior economist at Reis.\\r\\rAltogether, retailers soaked up 2.453 million square feet of U.S. neighborhood strip centers - shopping centers typically anchored by grocery stores or drug stores. That was down from 2.959 million square feet during the first quarter.\\r\\rAsking rent at the end of the quarter was $19.19 per square foot per year. Effective rent, which strips out free rent and other costs landlords incur to attract tenants, was $16.68 per square foot.\\r\\rRegional malls, where department stores typically book-end smaller specialty stores, had a vacancy rate of 8.3 percent in the second quarter, flat compared with the prior period.\\r\\rTop-tier malls in affluent areas are driving improvements in vacancy rates and asking rents as smaller shopping centers continue to suffer from weakness in the economy, Severino said. The top nine markets ranked by lowest vacancy rate are in California or the New York area suburbs, a trend that aligns with \"Class A\" malls outperforming inferior malls, he said.\\r\\r\"There\\'s a pretty big rift in the high-end centers that cater to the affluent and the other centers that cater to everyone else,\" said Severino. \"The wealthy are not immune to the economy, but they\\'re definitely more insulated.\"\\r\\rReal-estate companies that own malls and shopping centers in denser metropolitan areas and wealthier suburbs include Simon Property Group Inc, General Growth Properties Inc, Taubman Centers Inc, Kimco Realty Corp and Equity One Inc.',\n",
       " u'When Marc Kaye needed a loan to fund his boutique insurance firm at a time when payroll, his kids\\' college tuition and a mortgage payment were all draining his cash reserves, he didn\\'t go to a bank.\\r\\rInstead, he pulled a 1940s Picasso pencil drawing off his living room wall and made an appointment with Borro (borro.com), a high-end pawnbroker. Borro did not require mounds of paperwork, did not care about his credit rating and did not put him through the third degree over how the money would be used.\\r\\r\"I needed some immediate cash,\" says Kaye, who quickly got a six-month loan of $39,500, agreeing to a monthly interest rate of 3 percent plus about $175 in processing fees. \"I had never pawned anything before.\"\\r\\rKaye, based in New York, represents the type of upscale customer that those in the pawn broking industry say is becoming more prevalent - a small business owner facing a cash crunch. To serve this clientele, a specialized niche of pawnbrokers is gaining traction, defying the industry\\'s reputation as the lenders of last resort.\\r\\rSome offer in-person services in well-appointed offices, while others give customers the privacy of secure transactions over the Internet. The segment is developing at a time when the industry is pushing up-market, with big national chains such as EZPawn attempting to polish their reputations with the expansion of clean, well-lit stores.\\r\\rBorro, the service selected by Kaye, is somewhat of a hybrid, with a website that lets would-be borrowers make initial contact and office space to meet in-person for asset evaluations.\\r\\r\"We just call it online personal asset lending,\" says Paul Aitken, Borro\\'s chief executive officer, who founded the company in 2008 in London and opened a New York office in February 2012.\\r\\rHIGH-END GOODS\\r\\rBorro\\'s customers take loans against fine jewelry, wine collections and other valuables. The company, whose average loan is $15,000, has backed everything from a Formula 1 racecar to a Beatles record contract.\\r\\rThe business attracts customers through its website as well as referrals from private banks. Couriers typically pick up items and deliver them to Borro\\'s offices, where appraisers validate their worth. There are phone calls and sometimes face-to-face meetings, depending on the circumstances. Money is then wired to the customer\\'s account, with the entire process taking just a few days.\\r\\r\"The bigger the customer, the more high-touch it is,\" Aitken says.\\r\\rMost borrowers, he says, will extend the terms of their loans rather than forfeit merchandise, and many come back to use the service again. Backed by $40 million in venture capital, Borro\\'s loan volume has doubled each year, with small businesses now accounting for 60 of every 100 dollars loaned.\\r\\rAt Beverly Loan Co., a brick-and-mortar pawn business outside Los Angeles that has catered to the wealthy for 75 years, business is also brisk, and small business customers are on the rise, says owner Jordan Tabach-Bank.\\r\\rTo meet demand for loans ranging from a few thousand dollars to $1 million, he opened a second office in the New York City\\'s International Gem Tower; it offers well-heeled customers secure storage for everything from GIA-certified diamonds to Patek Philippe watches.\\r\\rAs the economy has slowly improved, Tabach-Bank says, clients are taking out loans to start new ventures, to cover larger payrolls or to meet inventory demand for products moving off shelves more quickly than expected.\\r\\r\"Pawn is becoming more mainstream,\" says Tabach-Bank, who has appeared on Discovery Channel\\'s antique dealer series \"Final Offer.\" \"There are pawn-based TV shows, they\\'re talking about pawn, people are feeling more comfortable.\"\\r\\rBut there is still an overhanging industry stigma, which is one reason for the popularity of online pawn broking sites such as Tyler, Texas-based iPawn (iPawn.com). iPawn\\'s transactions are strictly web-based, and customers receive an initial valuation of their merchandise by sending a photo.\\r\\rIf customers want to proceed with the process, the company obtains their valuables via a secure FedEx transaction. Once given a final offer, consumers can either take a loan or sell the asset outright.\\r\\r\"None of would go to a brick-and-mortar pawn shop,\" says Ben De-Kalo, CEO of iPawn, which was founded in late 2011. In less than a year, loans to small business owners have increased to 50 percent from 20 percent of all the firm\\'s loans.\\r\\rVARYING DEGREES OF COMFORT\\r\\rPawn-broking terms can vary considerably by jurisdiction, with interest rates typically higher than those on bank loans. Each state has its own regulations determining licensing, registration, reporting, records and related information.\\r\\rThe industry also adheres to federal regulations, including the USA Patriot Act, which requires loan customers to prove identity; the Truth in Lending Act, which calls for pawnbrokers to define the terms of the loan clearly; and Federal Trade Commission rules, to safeguard consumers\\' personal information, as well as other statutes.\\r\\rCustomers should be wary of pawnbrokers that undervalue their assets and should scrutinize the covenants of any pawn loan, says Rohit Arora, CEO of Biz2Credit (biz2credit.com), an online platform that offers a variety of financing options and consulting to small businesses.\\r\\rKaye, the New York-based entrepreneur, said he would not hesitate to would take another loan with a high-end pawnbroker.\\r\\r\"I felt very comfortable with the process,\" he said, assuring a reporter that his precious Picasso was once again hanging on his living room wall.',\n",

''Mechanically, I was very repeatable, and you saw the results. They were hitting a lot of ground balls, I had a high strike percentage, so that's what I'm looking for.''\\rDickey (7-8) retired his first 13 batters before James Loney grounded a single between shortstop and third base with one out in the fifth. Yunel Escobar had a one-out single in the sixth, then was erased when Matt Joyce hit a double-play grounder.\\r''Tremendous,'' Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. ''You could tell early on he had it going. That ball was dancing. Big break. We played a nice ballgame and as good a game as you can pitch, I guess, unless it's perfect.''\\rDickey struck out six and walked one.

       " u\"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Rays believe they have a star in the making in Wil Myers.\\rThe rookie homered in his home debut Monday night, continuing an impressive first week in the majors and helping Jeremy Hellickson beat the Blue Jays 4-1 to end Toronto's 11-game winning streak.\\r''He's very comfortable,'' Rays manager Joe Maddon said about Myers. ''He's not overwhelmed whatsoever.''\\rMyers made his major league debut in Boston at the start of a seven-game road trip that ended Sunday. He hit a grand slam off CC Sabathia for his first big league homer during a loss Saturday at Yankee Stadium.\\rThis time, the 22-year-old outfielder hit the second of three straight Tampa Bay homers in the second inning, connecting in his first at-bat at Tropicana Field.\\rMyers, who's hitting .294 with two home runs, a double and seven RBIs after eight games, received a standing ovation and took a curtain call for a crowd of 11,407 getting its initial close-up view of the key acquisition in the offseason trade that sent pitchers James Shields and Wade Davis to Kansas City for the power-hitting right fielder and other prospects.\\r''I wasn't sure what really to do but everyone kept cheering so I thought that might be my cue to go out there,'' Myers said. ''Actually, I saw that Zoilo Almonte guy get one (in New York) and everyone got up and kept cheering, so I thought it was the same deal for me.''\\rMyers' drive to center off Esmil Rogers (3-3) was sandwiched between home runs by James Loney and Sam Fuld as Tampa Bay went deep three times in a span of eight pitches. Luke Scott added a bloop RBI double to make it 4-0 in the third, and that was all the support Hellickson needed.\\rThe Rays estimated the ball Myers hit, which caromed off a wall beyond center field, traveled 422 feet before bouncing back onto the field.\\r''The ball comes off the bat hard with him. It makes a different sound,'' Maddon said. ''He's one of those guys. And the thing that I like is all this stuff is going through the middle of the field.''\\rA night after scoring a season-high 13 runs at home to complete a three-game sweep of Baltimore, the Blue Jays were limited to four singles and five walks. They came up short in their bid to extend the longest winning streak in the majors since Detroit won 12 straight in 2011.\\rHellickson (6-3) gave up J.P. Arencibia's single, walked four and struck out four. He allowed only one runner past first base - in the second inning, when Colby Rasmus walked and moved to third when Arencibia followed with his hit to center field.\\rThe Blue Jays stranded Rasmus, who drew three of Toronto's five walks, when Maicer Izturis grounded into an inning-ending double play.\\rToronto finally broke through in the eighth when it loaded the bases with one out against Alex Torres with a pair of singles and a walk. Jose Bautista grounded into a force play to drive in a run before Edwin Encarnacion flied out to end the threat.\\rFernando Rodney worked the ninth for the Rays, earning his 16th save in 21 opportunities.\\r''The three home runs hurt ... but their pitching shut us down. That was the story of the game,'' Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. ''It was a nice little streak. We'll start another one tomorrow. Losses are never easy, but we've been on a nice little roll.''\\rThe Blue Jays' longest winning streak in nearly 15 years matched the best in club history. They also won 11 straight in 1987 and 1998.\\rThe Rays began the day last in the AL East, one percentage point behind the surging Blue Jays, who gained seven games on Tampa Bay during their winning streak.\\rDespite the loss, Toronto has won 15 of 19 while outscoring opponents 103-57 to get back into the division race led by the Boston Red Sox.\\rLoney, Myers and Fuld went deep off Rogers with one out in the second, just the second time in franchise history - first at Tropicana Field - that Tampa Bay has hit three straight homers. Evan Longoria, Willy Aybar and Dioner Navarro did it on June 9, 2008, against the Angels.\\rMyers also had a single and was caught trying to steal second base in the sixth inning. He's 10 for 34 overall since being promoted from Triple-A Durham and is the first player in Rays history with seven RBIs in his first eight career games.\\r''He's got it all. He's got a chance to be a really, really good player,'' Gibbons said. ''It's all in there.''\\rNOTES: Toronto plans to activate SS Jose Reyes (left ankle) from the disabled list Wednesday. ... Blue Jays LHP J.A. Happ, who suffered a skull fracture and a sprained right knee when he fell to the ground at Tropicana Field after being struck behind the left ear by a line drive on May 7, is expected back at the ballpark Tuesday. Gibbons said Happ, slowed by the knee injury, is throwing off a mound at the team's spring training complex in Dunedin, Fla., but still has a ways to go before he pitches again. ... In preparation for his home debut, the Rays had Myers out on the field early to take fly balls in the domed stadium with the lights on and off. ... Blue Jays RHP Brandon Morrow (forearm) has not resumed throwing, while 3B Brett Lawrie (left ankle) is probably a couple of weeks from starting a rehab assignment. ...

They've won 15 of their past 18, outscoring their opponents 102-52 in that span.\\r''I've been waiting for this since the season started,'' Encarnacion said. ''I believe in this team so I knew things had to change, things had to become good for us. That's the way right now and we enjoy it, enjoy the moment. I'm not surprised by this. I know this team is good and I know we can do it.''\\rToronto has swept three consecutive series for the first time since 1998, the last time they won 11 straight. The Blue Jays also won 11 consecutive games in 1987.\\r''Everybody is doing their job, everybody is pitching in,'' Johnson said. ''It's been impressive.''\\rPlaying before a sellout crowd of 45,214, Toronto became the first team since Detroit in 2011 to win 11 straight.\\r''We're feeling pretty good about ourselves,'' Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. ''We shut down a really good team over there.''\\rThe Blue Jays, who begin a three-game series at Tampa Bay on Monday, have not lost since a 10-6 defeat at the Chicago White Sox on June 10.\\r''A lot of guys have been in a good rhythm at the same time, which is kind of what we didn't have to start the season,'' catcher J.P. Arencibia said.\\rRyan Flaherty hit two homers but Baltimore lost for the fifth time in eight games and allowed a season high in runs.\\r''We ran into a good team and came up short,'' Flaherty said.\\rJohnson (1-2) was winless in his first seven starts with Toronto, receiving just 13 total runs of support and losing twice. That changed Sunday, as the Blue Jays helped the right-hander with an early offensive barrage, scoring nine times in the first three innings.\\rJohnson allowed four runs and seven hits in six-plus innings, walked one and struck out five. He's 1-1 with a 2.84 ERA in four starts since missing 31 games with a right triceps injury, and has struck out 25 batters in his past 25 1-3 innings.\\r''It's not an easy lineup to face regardless of the score,'' Gibbons said. ''That's another good outing for him. That's one win. Getting on the board so you've got something to show for it always makes you feel good.''\\rAaron Loup, Juan Perez and Dustin McGowan each worked one inning.\\rFlaherty hit a two-run shot off Johnson in the seventh and a solo homer off McGowan in the ninth for his first career multihomer game. He has five home runs this season.\\rWith first base open, the Blue Jays intentionally walked Orioles slugger Chris Davis to load the bases for Matt Wieters in the first, but Johnson got Wieters to foul out.\\r''Every time you turn on the highlights he's doing some damage somewhere,'' Gibbons said of Davis. ''We've seen plenty of that. That's key, getting out of that first inning without any runs.''\\rArencibia was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the bottom half to drive in the game's first run.\\rThe Blue Jays used small ball and the long ball to score three more in the second. Emilio Bonifacio led off with a bunt single over the head of Baltimore starter Freddy Garcia, stole second and went to third on a sacrifice bunt before scoring on Melky Cabrera's sacrifice fly. Jose Bautista walked and Encarnacion followed with a first-pitch homer to left.\\rToronto blew it open with a five-run, bat-around third. Maicer Izturis and Bonifacio chased Garcia with back-to-back RBI doubles, bringing left-hander T.J. McFarland out of the bullpen. One out later, Cabrera singled home a run, Bautista walked and Encarnacion hit a two-run double.\\rBaltimore broke through against Johnson in the fifth, when Manny Machado led off with his ML-leading 34th double and scored on a double by Nick Markakis. Markakis went to third on Adam Jones' grounder and scored when Davis reached on Bonifacio's fielding error. Davis was credited with an RBI.\\rFlaherty's two-run homer made it 9-4 but Toronto answered with four in the bottom half. Colby Rasmus led off with a homer against McFarland, his 14th, and Bautista hit a bases-loaded double off Pedro Strop.\\rGarcia (3-5) had won his previous two outings in Toronto but lost for the third time in four starts. He allowed a season-worst seven runs and seven hits in 2 1-3 innings, his shortest start of the year.\\r''I made some good pitches and they just hit them,'' Garcia said. ''Right now everything is going good for them. It's part of the game. You can't do anything about it.''\\rMachado thought he'd fouled Johnson's strike three pitch into the dirt when he struck out in the first. After plate ump Doug Eddings checked the ball and upheld the call, Orioles manager Buck Showalter came out to see the ball for himself.\\rNOTES: Toronto GM Alex Anthopoulos told MLB Network Radio that SS Jose Reyes (left ankle) will play one more rehab game at Triple-A Buffalo on Monday, then will likely join Double-A New Hampshire when Buffalo goes on the road.

The Blue Jays, who are 14-4 this month, are one victory from matching the franchise record. Toronto had 11-game winning streaks in 1987 and 1998.\\r''It's been a great run and hopefully we can continue,'' Bautista said.\\rThe Blue Jays (37-36) are above .500 for the first time since last July 29, when they were 51-50.\\rBautista traded angry words with O'Day after striking out to end the seventh inning Friday, stranding a runner at second base.\\rOn Saturday, the Blue Jays slugger renewed the argument, yelling at O'Day while rounding the bases after his pivotal home run.\\r''I told him just to keep talking like he was yesterday because he kind of ran his mouth a little bit after he struck me out,'' Bautista said. ''I don't know where that came from but I didn't appreciate it. I let him know that yesterday and that's a little reminder today.''\\rO'Day declined to talk about his spat with Bautista, while Orioles manager Buck Showalter chalked it up to a clash of competitive personalities.\\r''Darren is a competitor, he likes to compete in those situations,'' Showalter said. ''Sometimes he wins, sometimes Bautista wins. You've got two great, talented athletes competing out there and they both take it personally.''\\rThe Blue Jays led 2-1 heading into the eighth but Taylor Teagarden tied it with a homer off reliever Darren Oliver.\\rOrioles starter Miguel Gonzalez left after Munenori Kawasaki hit a one-out single in the bottom half. O'Day came on and got Rajai Davis to ground into a fielder's choice, but Bautista followed with a two-out homer just inside the left-field foul pole on a 3-2 pitch.\\r''I made a terrible pitch,'' O'Day said. ''If I make a good pitch, he's probably out.''\\rBautista, who homered for the 16th time this season, said he wasn't sure his drive was going to stay fair.\\r''I had no idea it was going to go out, either,'' Bautista said. ''I knew I hit it well but I didn't know if it had enough.''\\rThe homer was the first allowed by O'Day since May 22, when Yankees infielder David Adams took him deep.\\rOliver (3-1) worked one inning and Casey Janssen finished for his 17th save in 18 chances.\\rGonzalez (5-3) allowed three runs and three hits in 7 1-3 innings.

Dickey said.\\rKawasaki went 2 for 4 with three RBIs. Eight of his 17 RBIs this season have come against the Orioles: he also beat them with a two-run double in the ninth inning of a 6-5 win on May 26.\\r''He's been doing that all year,'' Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. ''He's done a tremendous job for us.''\\rKawasaki has been playing shortstop for Toronto in the absence of Jose Reyes, who's been out since April 13 with a sprained left ankle. Reyes is currently rehabbing with Triple-A Buffalo and could be back Monday.\\rBut Kawasaki's continued heroics might just make him indispensable.\\r''Nobody has said that Kawasaki was going down,'' Gibbons said. ''People might assume that but we don't know what's going to happen, to be honest.''\\rCasey Janssen (2-0) worked one inning for the win while Adam Lind and Edwin Encarnacion both homered for the Blue Jays, who reached .500 for the first time since July 30, 2012.\\r''We're starting to become family and it's showing,'' Dickey said.\\rToronto has won 13 of its past 16 and has gone 26-15 since May 2, when they were a season-worst 10-21.\\r''We've definitely come back to life, that's for sure,'' Gibbons said. ''We're riding a nice high right now.''\\rFacing Orioles reliever Brian Matusz (2-1), Maicer Izturis singled to begin the ninth and moved to second on Josh Thole's sacrifice. Pinch-hitter Mark DeRosa was intentionally walked to bring up Kawasaki. With the crowd of 35,472 chanting his name, Kawasaki moved up both runners with a grounder.\\r''Unbelievable,'' Kawasaki said of the ovation. ''I was nervous.''\\rPedro Strop came on to face Davis, who lined a single over the head of shortstop J.J. Hardy. Davis' teammates poured out of the dugout in celebration, mobbing him and tearing off his jersey.\\r''We've got to give credit to Kawasaki,'' Davis said. ''He had some big hits with men on base. My hit doesn't even happen without those big hits.''\\rChris Davis hit his major league leading 27th home run for the Orioles, who also got homers from Hardy and Ryan Flaherty.\\rToronto took an early lead when Lind hit a two-run homer off Jason Hammel in the first, his 10th.

       " u\"TORONTO (AP) -- Josh Johnson took two extra days off to let a bothersome blister heal, then shut down the Colorado Rockies.\\rMaicer Izturis hit a two-run single in the eighth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays won their sixth consecutive game Monday night, beating Colorado 2-0 behind Johnson and two relievers.\\r''He had everything going on,'' Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. ''Good, live fastball, ball had a lot of jump on it, and a good breaking ball.''\\rJohnson struck out a season-high 10 over 7 1-3 innings but remained winless in seven starts with Toronto, having received only 13 runs of support. He said the blister on the middle finger of his right hand, which developed during his June 9 start against Texas and twice delayed his next outing by a day, was not an issue.\\r''Definitely the most comfortable I've been,'' said Johnson, who also missed 31 games with a sore right triceps. ''Just being able to get extension on all my pitches, not have to worry about the triceps or anything like that. It's definitely nice.''\\rJohnson, who allowed five hits and walked two, lowered his ERA from 5.40 to 4.38.\\r''He's definitely got some of the best stuff in the game,'' Colorado's Michael Cuddyer said. ''He's big, tall, throws hard. When he's throwing strikes like that, he can be tough. His fastball was getting on guys.''\\rBrett Cecil (3-0) escaped an eighth-inning jam and Casey Janssen finished for his 14th save in 15 chances.\\rIzturis had two of Toronto's three hits as the Blue Jays won six straight for the first time since May 10-16, 2011.\\rRajai Davis singled off reliever Matt Belisle (4-4) to start the eighth, just the second hit of the game for the Blue Jays. Davis stole second and Colby Rasmus walked, with both runners advancing on J.P. Arencibia's slow roller to the mound.\\rIzturis followed with a bloop single that dropped in front of left fielder Tyler Colvin, scoring both runners.\\r''He didn't hit it hard but he dunked it in the perfect spot,'' Gibbons said. ''A nice read at second base by Rasmus there.''\\rCuddyer singled and walked twice for the Rockies, who went 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position and lost for the fourth time in six games.\\rColorado starter Jorge De La Rosa didn't allow a hit until Izturis singled with one out in the sixth. That was the only hit the left-hander allowed in seven shutout innings. He walked three and struck out four.\\rDe La Rosa might have gone deeper, but had to pitch through soreness caused by a bruise on the tip of his thumb.\\r''In the second inning I threw a two-seamer and I think the seam caught a bit and that's why there was a little bruise,'' De La Rosa said. ''It was numb a little bit, for like two innings.''\\rDe La Rosa had pitched with a cut on his middle finger in his previous two starts.\\r''My hand hates me,'' he joked.\\rColorado manager Walt Weiss said De La Rosa's thumb issue was not considered serious.\\r''It's not anything that's going to be an issue with his next start,'' Weiss said. ''It just made him uncomfortable tonight.''\\rThe Rockies had several chances to score, but couldn't deliver. Cuddyer extended his hitting streak to 15 games, tying a career high, with a leadoff single in the second. Todd Helton followed with a single, sending Cuddyer to third, but Johnson struck out Wilin Rosario and Colvin, then got Nolan Arenado to fly out.\\rArenado ended a streak of 11 straight outs with a two-out double in the fifth, but Jonathan Herrera grounded out.\\rD.J. LeMahieu hit a one-out double in the sixth and went to third on a grounder by Carlos Gonzalez. Cuddyer walked but Helton ended the threat by popping out.\\rHerrera singled to begin the eighth and Dexter Fowler walked before both runners advanced on LeMahieu's sacrifice. Cecil replaced Johnson and got Gonzalez to line out sharply to first. Cuddyer was intentionally walked to bring up Helton, who grounded out.\\rNOTES: The home team has won all 13 meetings between these clubs, dating to 2002. Colorado is 0-7 at Rogers Centre. ... Toronto SS Jose Reyes (left ankle) went 2 for 3 in five innings of a rehab game with Class-A Dunedin.

       " u\"By dawn on June 6, thousands of paratroopers and glider troops were already on the ground behind enemy lines, securing bridges and exit roads. The amphibious invasions began at 6:30 a.m. The British and Canadians overcame light opposition to capture beaches codenamed Gold, Juno and Sword, as did the Americans at Utah Beach. U.S. forces faced heavy resistance at Omaha Beach, where there were over 2,000 American casualties. However, by day's end, approximately 156,000 Allied troops had successfully stormed Normandys beaches. According to some estimates, more than 4,000 Allied troops lost their lives in the D-Day invasion, with thousands more wounded or missing.\\r\\rLess than a week later, on June 11, the beaches were fully secured and over 326,000 troops, more than 50,000 vehicles and some 100,000 tons of equipment had landed at Normandy.\\r\\rFor their part, the Germans suffered from confusion in the ranks and the absence of celebrated commander Rommel, who was away on leave. At first, Hitler, believing the invasion was a feint designed to distract the Germans from a coming attack north of the Seine River, refused to release nearby divisions to join the counterattack. Reinforcements had to be called from further afield, causing delays. He also hesitated in calling for armored divisions to help in the defense. Moreover, the Germans were hampered by effective Allied air support, which took out many key bridges and forced the Germans to take long detours, as well as efficient Allied naval support, which helped protect advancing Allied troops.\\r\\rIn the ensuing weeks, the Allies fought their way across the Normandy countryside in the face of determined German resistance, as well as a dense landscape of marshes and hedgerows. By the end of June, the Allies had seized the vital port of Cherbourg, landed approximately 850,000 men and 150,000 vehicles in Normandy, and were poised to continue their march across France.\\r\\rVictory in Normandy\\rBy the end of August 1944, the Allies had reached the Seine River, Paris was liberated and the Germans had been removed from northwestern France, effectively concluding the Battle of Normandy. The Allied forces then prepared to enter Germany, where they would meet up with Soviet troops moving in from the east.\\r\\rThe Normandy invasion began to turn the tide against the Nazis. A significant psychological blow, it also prevented Hitler from sending troops from France to build up his Eastern Front against the advancing Soviets. The following spring, on May 8, 1945, the Allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. Hitler had committed suicide a week earlier, on April 30.\",\n",
       " u'After the German conquest of France in 1940, the opening of a second front in western Europe was a major aim of Allied strategy during World War II. On June 6, 1944, under the code name Operation \"Overlord,\" US, British and Canadian troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, on the English Channel coast east of Cherbourg and west of Le Havre.\\rUnder overall command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and, on the ground, of British General Bernard Montgomery, more than 130,000 Allied troops landed on five beaches, code named Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword, and Utah. On the night before the amphibious landings, 23,000 US and British paratroopers landed in France behind the German defensive lines by parachute and glider. The invasion force of more than 155,000 troops included 50,000 vehicles (including 1,000 tanks). Nearly 7,000 naval craft and more than 11,500 aircraft supported the invasion.\\rUnder the overall command of Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, the Germans had deployed five infantry divisions, one airborne division and one tank division along the Normandy coast and held the advantage in battle positioning. However, the Allies had an overwhelming advantage in naval and air power. On D-Day alone, the Allies flew 14,000 sorties; the German air force managed only 500 sorties. Moreover, a successful Allied deception plan had led the Germans to believe the point of the attack to be further north and east on the coast near Calais and the Belgian border. Fooled, the Germans moved only slowly to reinforce the Normandy defenses after the initial landing.\\rDespite Allied superiority, the Germans contained Allied troops in their slowly expanding beachhead for six weeks. The US 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions made the most difficult landing on Omaha Beach. Stiff German resistance here caused over 3,000 casualties before the Allied troops could establish their positions by the end of the first day. On D-Day itself, Allied troops suffered more than 10,000 casualties: British and Canadian forces suffered around 3,700 casualties; US forces took about 6,600 casualties. The German defenders lost between 4,000 and 9,000 men.\\rOn D-Day itself, the Allies landed 11 divisions on the French coast, but failed in reaching their planned objective of linking the beachheads or driving inland to a distance of nine miles. Within five days, on June 11, Allied troops overcame German resistance to unite the invasion beaches into one large beachhead.\\rOn July 25, 1944, Allied troops broke out of the Normandy beachhead near the town of St. Lo and began to pour into northern France. By mid-August, Allied troops had encircled and destroyed much of the German army in Normandy in the Falaise pocket. Spearheaded by General George Patton\\'s Third Army, the Allies then raced across France. On August 25, Free French forces liberated Paris; on September 16, US troops reached the border of Germany.\\rSince the Normandy invasion, June 6, 1944 has been known in World War II history as \"D-Day.\"',\n",
       " u'Preparing for D-Day\\rAfter World War II began, Germany invaded and occupied northwestern France beginning in May 1940. The Americans entered the war in December 1941, and by 1942 they and the British (who had been evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940 after being cut off by the Germans in the Battle of France) were considering the possibility of a major Allied invasion across the English Channel. The following year, Allied plans for a cross-Channel invasion began to ramp up. In November 1943, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), who was aware of the threat of an invasion along Frances northern coast, put Erwin Rommel (1891-1944) in charge of spearheading defense operations in the region, even though the Germans did not know exactly where the Allies would strike. Hitler charged Rommel with finishing the Atlantic Wall, a 2,400-mile fortification of bunkers, landmines and beach and water obstacles. \\r\\rIn January 1944, General Dwight Eisenhower (1890-1969) was appointed commander of Operation Overlord. In the months and weeks before D-Day, the Allies carried out a massive deception operation intended to make the Germans think the main invasion target was Pas-de-Calais (the narrowest point between Britain and France) rather than Normandy. In addition, they led the Germans to believe that Norway and other locations were also potential invasion targets. Many tactics was used to carry out the deception, including fake equipment; a phantom army commanded by George Patton and supposedly based in England, across from Pas-de-Calais; double agents; and fraudulent radio transmissions.\\r\\rA Weather Delay: June 5, 1944\\rEisenhower selected June 5, 1944, as the date for the invasion; however, bad weather on the days leading up to the operation caused it to be delayed for 24 hours. On the morning of June 5, after his meteorologist predicted improved conditions for the following day, Eisenhower gave the go-ahead for Operation Overlord. He told the troops: You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you.\\r\\rLater that day, more than 5,000 ships and landing craft carrying troops and supplies left England for the trip across the Channel to France, while more than 11,000 aircraft were mobilized to provide air cover and support for the invasion.',\n",
       " u\"Allied forces rehearsed their roles for D-Day months before the invasion. On 28 April 1944, in south Devon on the English coast, 638 U.S. soldiers and sailors were killed when German torpedo boats surprised one of these landing exercises, Exercise Tiger.[6]\\rIn the months leading up to the invasion, the allied forces conducted a deception operation, Operation Fortitude, aimed at misleading the Germans with respect to the date and place of the invasion.\\rThere were several leaks prior to or on D-Day. One such leak was the crossword that came out in The Herald and Review six days before the beach landings were to take place. Some of the answers consisted of Overlord, Neptune, Gold and other key terms to the invasions; the US government later declared that this was just a coincidence. Through the Cicero affair, the Germans obtained documents containing references to Overlord, but these documents lacked all detail.[7] Double Cross agents, such as Joan Pujol (code named Garbo), played an important role in convincing the German High Command that Normandy was at best a diversionary attack. U.S. Major General Henry Miller, chief supply officer of the US 9th Air Force, during a party at Claridge's Hotel in London complained to guests of the supply problems he was having but that after the invasion, which he told them would be before 15 June supply would be easier. After being told, Eisenhower reduced Miller to lieutenant colonel [Associated Press, June 10, 1944] and sent him back to the U.S. where he subsequently retired.[citation needed] Another such leak was General Charles de Gaulle's radio message after D-Day. He, unlike all the other leaders, stated that this invasion was the real invasion. This had the potential to ruin the Allied deceptions Fortitude North and Fortitude South. For example, Gen. Eisenhower referred to the landings as the initial invasion.\\rOnly 10 days each month were suitable for launching the operation: a day near the full Moon was needed both for illumination during the hours of darkness and for the spring tide, the former to illuminate navigational landmarks for the crews of aircraft, gliders and landing craft, and the latter to expose defensive obstacles placed by the German forces in the surf on the seaward approaches to the beaches. A full moon occurred on 6 June. Allied Expeditionary Force Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. The weather was fine during most of May, but deteriorated in early June. On 4 June, conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing; wind and high seas would make it impossible to launch landing craft from larger ships at sea, low clouds would prevent aircraft finding their targets. The Allied troop convoys already at sea were forced to take shelter in bays and inlets on the south coast of Britain for the night.\\rIt seemed possible that everything would have to be cancelled and the troops returned to their embarkation camps (which would be almost impossible, as the enormous movement of follow-up formations into them was already proceeding).[8] The next full moon period would be nearly a month away. At a vital meeting on 5 June, Eisenhower's chief meteorologist (Group Captain J.M. Stagg) forecast a brief improvement for 6 June. Commander of all land forces for the invasion General Bernard Montgomery and Eisenhower's Chief of Staff General Walter Bedell Smith wished to proceed with the invasion. Commander of the Allied Air Forces Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory was doubtful, but the Allied Naval supremo Admiral Bertram Ramsay believed that conditions would be marginally favorable. On the strength of Stagg's forecast, Eisenhower ordered the invasion to proceed. As a result, prevailing overcast skies limited Allied air support, and no serious damage could be done to the beach defences on Omaha and Juno.[9]\\rThe Germans meanwhile took comfort from the existing poor conditions, which were worse over Northern France than over the English Channel itself, and believed no invasion would be possible for several days. Some troops stood down, many senior officers were away for the weekend. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel took a few days' leave to celebrate his wife's birthday,[10] while dozens of division, regimental and battalion commanders were away from their posts conducting war games just prior to the invasion.[11]\",\n",
       " u\"Background to the Invasion of Normandy\\r\\rAlthough planning for the operation began in the summer of 1942, the powerful offensive capability of German ground forces in Western Europe, the need to contain the U-boat threat to the Atlantic convoy routes, the strategic decision to divert troops and amphibious craft to the Mediterranean, and the ensuing difficulties of building up offensive forces in Britain, all combined to prevent an invasion of France in the following year. By late 1943, however, detailed planning for the invasion had taken place and significant forces and material had been gathered in Britain.\\r\\rThe naval component of the operation, code named Operation NEPTUNE, comprised large numbers of warships, auxiliaries and landing craft. In all, Britain, Canada, and the United States, as well as the navies-in-exile of France, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Greece, supplied 1,213 warships for the invasion. Their main task was to provide shore bombardment firepower for the troops going ashore, to guard the transports, and to conduct minesweeping and antisubmarine patrols on the flanks of the invasion corridor. The same navies also provided 4,126 amphibious craft, including a variety specialized landing craft, such as LSTs (Landing Ship, Tank), LCIs (Landing Craft, Infantry), and LCTs (Landing Craft, Tank [Rocket]). More than 3,500 of these landing craft were actually used during the Normandy Invasion. These amphibious craft would provide the crucial troop-carrying capacity to land the thousands of men, vehicles, and artillery along the 50-mile wide target area in the Bay of the Seine.\\r\\rThe initial assault from landing ships and craft was on a five-division front between the Orne River and the Cotentin Peninsula. The region was divided into five landing beaches, code named (from west to east) Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. The first two beaches were assigned to the largely American-manned Western Task Force and the other three were the responsibility of the British-dominated Eastern Task Force. Although the Allies faced impressive German defenses, which were heavily fortified with concrete, wire, and other outworks, they knew from experience that an initial lodgment was impossible to prevent. The overall battle itself, however, would be decided by the ability of the Allies to reinforce their initially-weak beachhead by sea as compared to the easier movement of German reinforcements by land. The Allies believed they would have the advantage in such a race since they enjoyed superior concentration of force on the beaches--provided by the guns of the mobile warships--and virtually dominated the air over northern France.\\r\\rThe Battle\\r\\rOn 5 June 1944, the thousands of ships and craft taking part in Operation NEPTUNE put to sea and began gathering in assembly areas southeast of the Isle of Wight. From there, many passed through the channels swept through the German defensive minefields and moved into their respective waiting areas before dawn on 6 June. Hundreds of antisubmarine escorts and patrol planes protected the flanks of these assault convoys. Between 0530 and 0550, the Allied gunfire support task groups began bombarding prearranged targets along the beaches.\\r\\rIn the American sector, the landing at Utah beach began at 0630 and--despite occurring slightly south of the target area--proceeded according to plan as the U.S. 4th division advanced rapidly toward its initial objectives. At Omaha beach, where the landings began at 0635, underwater obstacles bottled up many of the amphibious craft and the congestion provided easy targets for German gunners. The landing bogged down and it took a combination of short-range destroyer gunnery support, aerial bombardment and desperate infantry assaults to break the German defenses. It was not until noon that the U.S. 1st and 29th divisions crossed the beach line in force.\\r\\rThe British sector proceeded more smoothly. Despite rougher seas and higher-than-expected tides, which hindered the clearance of beach obstacles, excellent naval gunfire support kept German defensive fire suppressed at Sword and Juno beaches. The landings there, which began at 0730 and 0735 respectively, proceeded apace and the British 3d and Canadian 3d divisions moved inland by early afternoon. At Gold beach, where the 50th division landed at 0725, the beach obstacles were more numerous than expected and many landing craft were lost. This hindered the buildup of forces ashore and it wasn't until nightfall that the beach was secured.\\r\",\n",
       " u\"In 1942, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt issued a statement that the western allies would work as quickly as possible to open a second front to relieve pressure on the Soviets. Though united in this goal, issues soon arose with the British who favored a thrust north from the Mediterranean, through Italy and into southern Germany. Against this, the Americans advocated a cross-Channel assault which would move through Western Europe along the shortest route to Germany. As American strength grew, they made it clear that this was the only approach they would support.\\r\\rCodenamed Operation Overlord, planning for the invasion began in 1943. In November of that year, planning passed to General Dwight D. Eisenhower who was promoted to Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and given command of all Allied forces in Europe. Moving forward, Eisenhower adopted a plan begun by the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC). The COSSAC plan called for landings by three divisions and two airborne brigades in Normandy. This area was chosen by COSSAC due to its proximity to England, which facilitated air support and transport, as well as its favorable geography.\\r\\rD-Day - The Allied Plan:\\r\\rAdopting the COSSAC plan, Eisenhower appointed General Sir Bernard Montgomery to command the invasion's ground forces. Expanding the COSSAC plan, Montgomery called for landing five divisions, preceded by three airborne divisions. These changes were approved and planning and training moved forward. In the final plan, the American 4th Infantry Division was to land at Utah Beach in the west, while the 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions landed to the east on Omaha Beach. These were separated by a headland known as Pointe du Hoc. Topped by German guns, capture of this position was tasked to the 2nd Ranger Battalion.\\rSeparate and to the east of Omaha were Gold, Juno, and Sword Beaches which were assigned to the British 50th, Canadian 3rd, and British 3rd Infantry Divisions respectively. These units were supported by armored formations as well as commandoes. Inland, the British 6th Airborne Division was to drop to the east of the landing beaches to secure the flank and destroy several bridges to prevent the Germans from bringing up reinforcements. The US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were to drop to the west with the goal of opening routes from the beaches and destroying artillery that could fire on the landings (Map).\",\n",
       " u\"The Allied invasion (code name, Operation Overlord) of France's Normandy region during World War II began on June 6, 1944 (D-Day). The operation, which landed about 1 million troops by July 1, was under the supreme command of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Germans, unaware of the exact invasion point, had 50 infantry and 10 panzer (tank) divisions dispersed in France and the Low Countries under the command of Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt.\\rFor the two months preceding D-Day, British-based aircraft had systematically bombed rail lines, bridges, and airfields on French soil. Throughout the preceding night paratroops were dropped inland to disrupt enemy communications. Naval guns pounded shore installations, and in the early daylight at low tide about 5,000 Allied ships approached the Normandy coastline. The British and Canadians moved in smoothly at the eastern landing points Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches, above Caen as did the Americans (under Omar Bradley) at Utah Beach, the westernmost landing site. At Omaha Beach, pivot of the landings, American troops securing their bridgehead were met by heavy German gunfire. Within five days 16 Allied divisions had landed in Normandy, and the final drive to liberate Europe was under way.\",\n",
       " u'The D-Day Invasion of Normandy laid a beachhead for the Allies on the Western Front of Europe. This battle was the single most important battle on the Western front because a defeat would have been tragic for Allied morale. D-Day is the military codeword for the paratrooper operations on the night of June 5 and the beach landings on the morning of June 6 in Normandy. On the morning of June 6, 1944, it was cloudy and pouring rain. The tide was low, and thousands of soldiers from America, Britain, Canada, and many other countries were prepared to storm the beaches. The battle was going to be fierce, and thousands of men would lose their lives fighting.\\r                  \\r       \\r        \\rFor one to understand D-day, one must first understand World War II. The war started on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland with Russia. The Russians had signed a non-aggression pact with Germany on August 23, 1939. The British and the French were outraged because of the invasion and declared war on Germany. Poland was taken over in as little as seventeen days. Germany also invaded France and the Low Countries on May 8, 1940. The Low Countries were invaded by Germany to get around the Maginot Line, which was a huge fortification stretching the whole distance of the French-German border, but not to the Low Countries. The surprise confused the French Army, and the French surrendered on June 22. The British forces that went to protect France were forced to retreat at the port of Dunkirk. This retreat was an embarrassment for the British army, and they planned to have revenge by invading France and taking it back from Germany. However, Germany was not the only aggressor.\\r                        \\rOn the morning of December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. The attack on Pearl Harbor caused a declaration of war by Congress the next day. Three days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States. The United States, now at war, beat the Germans in North Africa and invaded Italy in 1942-1944 with the British. On June 4, 1944, two days before D-Day, the Allies captured Rome. The Germans launched an invasion of Russia, code-named Operation Barbarossa, in June of 1941. However, the invasion was pushed back by the Russians with great victories at Kursk and Stalingrad, and the Russians made an immediate counterattack in December of 1941.  The Russians did not want to fight the whole German Army alone. They asked for a British-American invasion of Western Europe at the Conferences of Alta and Teheran. Britain and America answered Russias call. Their plan was to liberate Western Europe, code-named Operation Overlord, and its first step was in Normandy.\\r                            \\r            Before the Allies could plan an invasion, they had to get a supreme commander. The Americans and the British had argued about this for months until they decided that General Dwight D. Eisenhower was the Supreme Commander with British generals as his chiefs of staff. A difference in opinion by the American and the British generals was evident. The Americans favored invading at Calais. The British Chiefs of Staff, already not having a high regard for Eisenhower, favored invading at Normandy. The choice was Normandy, but Calais still played a part. The fictitious U.S. 1st Army, led by General George S. Patton, placed dummy installations on the beaches of Calais. The dummy installations caused speculation by the German high command.\\r                   \\r            The German commanders did expect an invasion, but they did not know where it would take place. Some thought that the assault would be on Norway because the British 4th Army was stationed in Scotland. Adolf Hitler and Field Marshall von Rundstedt believed the invasion spot would be at Calais. General Rommel, von Rundstedts inferior, believed that an invasion would be at Normandy. Since Rommel was von Rundstedts inferior, Rommels opinion was not accepted. It was these clear faults in intelligence by the German high command that made them ill prepared for an invasion at Normandy on June 6.',\n",
       " u\"In March 1943, the Allies had decided to invade in Normandy. The region was right because it was within fighter cover of British airfields and, perhaps more important, was considered a less likely site than Calais. It was important that the Germans remain confused about the actual invasion site, so elaborate plans were enacted to make them think Calais was the true target, including the creation of the fictional First U.S. Army Group and the placement of a fleet of unseaworthy landing craft in British ports across from Calais.\\r\\rAdding credence to the hoax was the appointment of General George Patton, one of the most successful and recognizable leaders of the war, as commander of the First U.S. Army Group. The ruse worked: Germany, certain that the high-profile Patton would be in charge of the invasion, kept its Fifteenth Army in the Calais area in the belief that it was to be the real invasion site.\\r\\rThe date of the Normandy invasion was based on a number of factors, including the tides (which would have to be low when the invasion force struck), the weather (minimal winds to reduce choppy seas), and the light (moonlight was important on the eve of the invasion, and enough early morning sunlight was needed at the moment the assault was to begin).\\r\\rBased on these and other factors, the best time to invade was determined to be from early May to early June. June 5 was the set date, but bad weather forced Eisenhower to postpone the event 24 hours. It was a crucial decision: If the Germans were to discover at the last minute what was happening, the additional day would give them time to bolster coastal defenses at the invasion point. The weather report for June 6 wasn't perfect, but Eisenhower was set against postponing the invasion again.\",\n",
       " u\"Four thousand ships moved Allied troops across the English Channel to the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, D-Day (invasion day). A gigantic gun and rocket bombardment from Allied warships softened up resistance in the landing areas, while planes swept the skies clear of German defenders and attacked German troops on the ground. Paratroops and glider-borne troops had landed in the rear the night before the invasion, disrupting German defenses and capturing strategic locations.\\r\\rThe invasion came as a surprise to the Germans. They had expected a landing at Calais and were convinced that the Normandy landings were merely a diversion to pull defenders away from the site of the real invasion, which would occur later. By the time Hitler committed his heavy panzer units, a firm beachhead had already been established. Nonetheless, there was heavy fighting before the beaches were secured, particularly at Omaha Beach in the American sector. (The beaches attacked by American troops were code-named Omaha and Utah, and those attacked by British and Canadian troops were called Gold, Juno, and Sword.)\\r\\rThe British troops struck out toward Caen, while the American First Army moved to capture the port of Cherbourg. Cherbourg's port facilities were needed to handle the enormous shipments of supplies required to keep the troops on the offensive. To unload ships until the port could be taken, breakwaters were constructed off the invasion beaches by sinking old ships and huge prefabricated caissons to form artificial harbors, which were code-named Mulberries. Despite being damaged by a storm on June 19, these facilities were a great success.\\r\\rThe Allied offensive was slowed by the dense hedgerows of the French countryside. which provided excellent defensive positions for the German troops. After heavy fighting and great losses, Cherbourg was taken on June 27. Strong German resistance held the British outside Caen until July 9. Meanwhile the Americans probed southward, seeking a break in the German lines.\"]"
