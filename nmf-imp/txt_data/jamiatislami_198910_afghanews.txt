                    US official meets with Zahir Shah
Soviets send huge convoy to Kandahar
  * A huge supply convoy reached Kabul regime forces at Kandahar on September 15, after covering 700 kilometers in two weeks, Mujahideen sources reported.
    The convoy consisted of 1000 trucks and oil tankers escorted by 200 tanks and 100 armored cars. The regime's air force also provided cover for the convoy, which brought ammunition and fuel to the besieged city of Kandahar.
    The convoy entered Afghanistan from the Soviet Union at the Toorghundi border post. It is believed that the personnel accompanying the convoy are newly trained soldiers and officers who were given this job after completing their training in the Soviet Union.
    The convoy was attacked along the road in Herat, Fatah and Kandahar, and several vehicles were destroyed. It veered across the desert near Kandahar to avoid ambushes set by the Mujahideen along the highway.
    This is the first convoy which has reached Kandahar since the Soviet troop withdrawal. A Kabul regime spokesman claimed the convoy has brought enough fuel and ammunition for six months.
    Afghan Interim Government press releases predicted that the Kabul regime might try to recapture Speenboldak, a town on the Pakistan border southeast of Kandahar. Previous efforts by the regime's militiamen to capture the town have not been successful.
    Observers see such a huge convoy as a sign of Soviet commitment to supply the regime at any cost.
    Some people expected the Mujahideen to stop and destroy the convoy along the way. Flat terrain, however, as well as the presence of the 200 T-62 tanks and 100 armored cars and the convoy's protection by aircraft, enabled it to reach Kandahar.
     Talks between the ex-king and an American diplomat has given new hope to supporters of the deposed monarch that he might return to the political life of Afghanistan.
     A senior American diplomat, Jon Holmes, met with Mohammad Zahir in Rome to discuss Afghan issues with him.
     American officials have said that meetings with Zahir Shah do not indicate a change of policy towards the Afghan resistance.
     They say also that it was not their first meeting with the ex-king. The Americans said that they asked the ex-king to render his support to the interim government but that his answer has not been positive.
     Prof. Sayyaf, the Prime Minister of the Interim Government, has told reporters in Peshawar that the ex-king cannot play a role in the future politics of Afghanistan.
     Because of the stalemate on the battlefield and the failure of the Interim Government to broaden its base, the Americans have started to look for other options.
     Kabul and the Soviets have always shown interest in persuading Zahir Shah to support their "national reconciliation" efforts.
     Soviet envoy to Kabul met with king in Rome last year and Najib has claimed that his envoys have met the ex-king several times. It is difficult to verify Najib's claim.
     Hie ex-lring who has not been active in the resistance, is considered an opponent of the Soviet occupation and the communist regime. The issue of Zahir Shah will divide Afghans further and weaken the position of the Interim Government
     Despite American statements that their policy towards Afghanistan has not changed the meeting with Zahir Shah and open criticism of the interim government by some American official could be a signs of some sorts of change.
     American have made no such a commitment to the Afghan resistance to prevent them from supporting other options. They have not recognized the Interim Government
     As in the past those who favor the return of the long to Afghan political scene are not clear about his role.
     The ex-king seems interested in some kind of role but has not been active to pave the road for his return. It seems that he is waiting for the time when all Afghans and superpowers offer him a role.
     No doubt Afghans want peace but introduction of a new element in the political scene may not offer a quick solution. Lack of an effective organization to support the king and his personality which try to avoid difficult decisions may disappoint those who see a solution in his return.
     Lack of progress in the battlefield has made the Soviet and regime more hopeful about the future of the communist regime and less compromising. Previous assumption by some circles that Gorbachev will sacrifice his communists Mend in Afghanistan for the sake of good relations with the US and West proved to be wrong. Soviet commitment in support of the regime has surprised the Americans. In the light of these developments there is no place for great hope that Zahir Shah option even if accepted by resistance (or imposed on it) be acceptable to the Soviets and the regime.
 Rocket hits UN plane
     A UN plane was damaged when Mujahideen fired rockets into the Kabul airport oh September 14.
     UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar voiced concern over the incident, but said that he did not believe that the UN plane was a target of the Mujahideen attack. Benon Sevan, the General Secretary's special representative, was on the plane but was not hurt

Comr. Hamisha Gul
     Commander Hamisha Gul was bom 36 years ago in a poor village in Sayed Abad district of Wardak province.
     His father was a fanner working on other people's land. "In the winters my father used to work in Peshawar to get some money. Perhaps we were the worest family in the Milli Khail vil-age. My mother could read and write. She taught me the Quran and helped me to leam the basics of Islam," Hamisha Gul recalled. "It was my mother who had a keen interest to send me to school," the commander said.
     His elder brother helped him to go to the primary school in the Milli Khail where he was bora
     "After six years of schooling one day a delegation came to choose students for the military school in Kabul. 1 was selected and taken to Kabul." Commander said.
     Hamisha Gul completed his military school scoring the highest marks and joined the military college. Again he was the best amongst, his classmates. He completed his college scoring first division awarded with a golden watch which was the most prestigious award for the graduates of the military college.
     He became a signal officer at Qala-i-Jangi division in Kabul. After one year he was appointed as a lecturer in the same military college that he graduated from. He worked for six years as a
     An Indian diplomat has met with the Iran-based Mujahideen parties in order to leam their views on solving the Afghan problem.
     The Indian external-affairs undersecretary visited Tehran to discuss bilateral issues, including Afghanistan, with the Iranian leaders.
     India has failed to condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and has maintained close ties with the Soviet-backed Kabul regime.
     The Indians, like the Soviets, are making use of.their good relations with Iran to contact Afghan parties based in that country. Due to the past anti-Mujahideen position of India and its close ties with the regime, its government is not in a good position to play the role of a peacemaker.
     India dislikes the Mujahideen based in Pakistan because of its longstanding
 lecturer and then was sent to Egypt to leam about commando tactics. From 197^-1978 while the communists took over, he was a commando teacher at division No. 8 in Qargha.
     Hamisha Gul escapes from Kabul to Wardak and from there to Peshawar. Jami'at provided him with some weapons and became die head of Mujahideen in Wardak.
     He established his first base at Gurbat mountains at Sayed Abad . He started Jehad with 40 people.
     "The people helped us a lot They used to give us food and encourage their sons to join us." Hamisha Gul said.
     His fist successful operation was in 1979, in which he was able to push back the offensive launched by the regime’ forces . Three hundred government soldiers were killed and 48 were captured by his Mujahideen. He captured SO Kalashnikov rifles which was significant booty at that time.
     Hamisha Gul expanded his base and was able to increased the number of his Mujahideen from 40 to 600.
     His main source of arms and ammunitions at the beginning was road ambushes.
     "The regime defence minister, Shahnawaz Tanai was my classmate and Deputy of Commander Ismail, Allaudin Khan was my student” He said.
     He is married and has four children.

 Mujaddidi meets with US Senator
    US Senator Pell met with the president of the Afghan Interim Government (AIG), Sebghatullah Mujaddidi in Peshawar on August 24.
    In the talks which continued for two hours, the military and political situations in Afghanistan came under discussion.
    Hezb Islami (Hikmatyar Suspended its membership of the AIG, a communique of Hezb wrote on August 28.
    According to the communique the ministers of Hezb will not participate in the cabinet meetings until the election process has started.
    Hezb says that it is suspending its membership in the government because AIG has failed to hold elections as it had promised.
    The other reason for the decision could be Hezb's unhappiness about the way some members of the government criticized Hezb's involvement in the Farkhar incident
    There are indications of covert efforts by friends of Afghans to bring Hikmatyar back to the fold of the government. Some Arab are involved in these efforts. They are also trying to improve relations between Hezb and lami'at which became tense over the Ferkhar incident
 Film director, actors defect to Mujahideen

    Sediqullah Barmak has directed three films namely Diwar (Wall), Daira (Circle) and Baigana (Stranger).
    They intend u> put their services at the disposal of the Mujahideen. The Supervisory Council has assured them of every assistance to do die job.

     A. I do not think the war will be very long. Some hard blows will be enough to bring the regime to its knees.
     Q. Are you considering psychological warfare?
     A. If some cities are captured the regime will be demoralized.
     Q. To overthrow the regime. will you attack Kabul, or could the regime be defeated without attacking Kabul?
     A. I prefer to attack other cities, before attacking Kabul. Capturing other cities and cutting supply lines will make a campaign against Kabul easier.
     Q. It seems that you have two types of organizations, the Army and the Supervisory Council. Do you want these two organizations to spread all over Afghanistan?
     A. No, we do not want our organization to spread all over Afghanistan. Our purpose is to show our people that these types of organizations can answer the needs of the Mujahideen. We hope, after some victories on the battlefield, to reach some kind of understanding with the rest of die commanders all over Afghanistan, and through consultation, to serve our people.
     Q. Don't you have a plan to ask people to rise against the regime in the cities?
     A. People will be mobilized tQ take such action at the last stages of the war.
     Q. In whose favor is time?
     A. As we had said before, while the Soviets were present in Afghanistan, time was in our favor. Since the withdrawal, time is in favor of the regime, especially with regard to outside support. We hope that by achieving military victories, we can change this situation.
     Q. Can the Supervisory Council compete with the Kabul regime?
     A. God willing, yes.
     Q. Can you compete with AIG?
     A* We do not have any competition with AIG. We want to see it stronger, not weaker.
     Q. You say there is no competition between the Council and the AIG, but the people in Taloqan know nothing about the AIG. They talk only about the Supervisory Council.
     A. The interim government has done nothing for the people. It is up to the AIG how soon it can be recognized by the people in Afghanistan.
     Q. For how long will you support the Interim Government?
     A. We support the AIG conditionally. The AIG should pave the road for general elections. I hope it can do this.
     Q. Has not the weakness of the
 AIG strengthened the position of the Kabulregime?
     A. The AIG was formed some months ago, but Jehad has continued for many years. Failure of the AIG cannot be considered the failure of the Mujahideen. The weakness of the AIG can delay the victory of the Mujahideen, but will not prevent it
     Q. Some Pushtoon leaders say that they mil prevent you from capturing Kabul. What is your message to them?
     A. This is enemy propaganda. Within the Council we have dozens of Pushtoon commanders and we have cordial relations with commanders in other parts of Afghanistan. We have good relations with Kandahar, Paktia and Ningaihar.
     Q. In Julyt Hezb-i-Islami killed some of your commanders. Is this the beginning of a civil war?
     A. We are not in favor of infighting or of spreading it to other areas. We wanted to suppress those responsible for the tragedy, and we did.
     Q. Do you consider Hezb’s action in Farkhar an act cffrustration or was it part of a strategy against you?
     A. Hezb has a history of these types of actions. Engineer Hikmatyar cannot tolerate his rivals. Hezb does not have any program for the defeat of the Kabul regime. He (Hikmatyar) opposes those people who do have a program, and create problems for them. Hezb was fully aware of the purpose of our meeting in Faikhar and that it would end the present stalemate on the battlefield. This was the reason for setting the ambush.
     Q. What is your message to Hikmatyar?
     A. We have made it clear to the Hezb leadership on different occasions that without unity, positive work cannot be done in Afghanistan. We want to cooperate with Hezb; because of the present situation there is. a great need for unity and cooperation. I hope Hezb will take practical steps in this direction.
     Q, Do you need outside assistance or can you fight with what you have?
     A. We have always tried to be self-sufficient We paid attention to this problem from die beginning of die war. But because of the massive Soviet support to the regime, the Mujahideen need to be supported.
     Q. The US and other countries' support for the Mujahideen is decreasing. What is your messqge to them?
     A. Those who have supported our cause should not be disappointed over the delay of the fall of the Kabul re-
 gime. They should not think that the Mujahideen do not have the ability to overthrow the regime. They should realize that die Mujahideen need time to move from a defensive phase in die war to an offensive phase. We hope that the time of transition will be as short as possible.
    Editorial
                                                    From page (4)
 the US in 1986. lt drew the attention of George Shultz, the then US Secretary of State, towards this problem. Mujahideen leaders told him thatthey will face problems in fighting the well-equipped communist regime without foreign military assistance.
    In 1989, a member of Jami'at Islami visited Washington to talk to US officials about die post-withdrawal problems. His message — that the war would last longer than generally believed, and that there was a need for continued military aid — did not get through. They had believed (without good reason) that "regime would fall under its own weight".
    This attitude towards the tyar is the source of problems confronting the resistance to day. Those who believed in an easy victory started to talk about buying Stinger missiles back from the Mujahideen. They felt no need for planning. If the shortages of supplies are not because of a political decision, then they are definitely a product of oversimplification of die situation.
    The Mujahideen believe in their final victory. It may come late, but it will definitely come. Escalation of the war is the only way tq achieve this aim. Either die regime null be defeated militarily, or military action will pave the way^for a just political solution.
    The war efforts will be successful if the Mqjahideen re-organize themselves for an offensive war, adopt a sound political and military strategy and have enough weapons and ammunition.
    It is the moral responsibility of all those who support the right of nations to determine their future to help us.
    Afghans want those countries who have promised support to fulfill their promise, and those who have no intention of doing anything, not to promise anything.
    If America cannot help the Afghans for some reason, it should not give a pretext to Gorbachev to continue sending deadly weapons to oppose American moves in Afghanistan.

        Vorontsov ends his mission in Kabul
    Soviet Ambassador to Kabul, Yuli Vorontsov, ended his mission on September 10.
    He was appointed to the post in 1988 before the Soviets started the withdrawal of their troops.
    Vorontsov, who was also the first deputy foreign minister, played a key role in maintaining Soviet support for the Kabul regime.
    He played an active political role during and after the withdrawal of troops. He held two rounds of talks with the seven-party alliance and Iran-based parties. He also met with Zahir Shah to persuade him to work with the PDPA.
    He was more than an ambassador to Afghanistan. Vorontsov tried very hard to unite the communists and divide the resistance. His separate talks with Iran-based parties and Zahir Shah, and
attempts to contact the field commanders, were aimed at driving a wedge between the resistance groups.
     He was neither successful in uniting the communists nor in dealing with different resistance groups separately.
     The communist regime did not fall while he was in Kabul, but he left behind an isolated regime facing tremendous problems.
     Vorontsov mixed diplomatic tactics with threats of force, both at the negotiating table and in Kabul as ambassador.
     He ordered the arrest of opponents of Najib within the PDPA, and was responsible for the massacre of several hundred people in Salang in January of the current year.
     His replacement in Kabul has not been announced.
NAM for broad-based government in Kabul
     The Non-Aligned Movement summit in Belgrade has asked for the formation of a broad-based government in Afghanistan and declared the need for intra-Afghan dialogue.
     The ninth session of NAM, which ended on September 8, also stressed the need to pave the way for the voluntary return of the Afghan refugees.
     Najibullah, the head of the Kabul regime, attended the summit. The Kabul regime had proposed that formation of an international conference on Afghanistan should be included in the final document of the summit, but this was rejected due to opposition by Pakistan.
     Prof. Mujaddidi, the president of Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan, sent a message to the new chairman of the Movement, President Janez Dmovsek of Yugoslavia, asking that the Afghan seat in the Movement should be given to the Interim Government
     The final declaration on Afghanistan is similar to the UN's unanimous resolution of last year.
     While the Mujahideen agree that a broad-based government should be formed, they are against the participation of the Kabul regime in that government. They also reject any kind of dialogue with the regime.
     The NAM stand on Afghan issue has not been strong from the start Its resolution did not mention the Soviets as an aggressor.
     During the occupation of Afghanistan, the NAM leadership fell into the hands of countries which had special ties with the Soviet Union. They softened the tone, of the resolution to suit the Soviets and the puppet regime, which is a member of NAM.

ami'at gives its schools
    The Education Committee of Jami'at Islami was handed over to the Ministry of Education of the Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan on September 12.
    This was announced at a meeting convened for the occasion by the Education Committee of Jami'at. Prof. Rabbani, Jami'at leader and Farooq Azam, the Education Minister participated as chief guests.
    Prof. Rabbani stressed the need for equal educational opportunities for all Afghans. He also stressed the need for clear objectives and homogeneous curriculum.
    Jami'at Education Committee runs hundreds of schools in the refugees camps in Iran and Pakistan, as well as inside Afghanistan.
    Some other parties also have shown a readiness to give their educational responsibilities to the Interim Government Prof. Sayyafs party has handed over its education committee as well.
    One of the reasons for the decision could be financial. Parties find themselves in a difficult position when trying to finance such a huge network of schools scattered in three countries, while their resources are shrinking daily.
              AIG tribunal starts hearing of Farkhar killing
     A six-member Tribunal appointed by the Afghan Interim Government (AIG) has reached Takhar to investigate the Ferkhar massacre.
     Jami'at and Hezb who are die two sides of the case have pledged to accept the judgement of the tribunal which is composed of religious Ulama.
     It took seven weeks before the tribunal was announced. In the mean-time Sayed Jamal who allegedly ordered the massacre was captured along with his men by the Mujahideen from the Supervisory Council.
     The tribunal is headed by Maulawi Qalander and a Pakistani religious scholar from Chitral is also a member.
     Originally an Arab scholar, Abdullah Ezam, was named but he refused to be part of the delegation because after returning from a fact finding mission to the area immediately after the incident he had formed an opinion. This scholar had told the Mujahideen in the area that Jamal who ordered Farkhar killing must be called Jamal Rushdi, the notorious British writer whose satanic verses has offended million Muslims
     It is too early to say anything about the outcome of the this mission. But some people think that the tribunal may try to make a reconciliation between the Mujahideen rather than to pass a verdict on the incident.

            General Assembly to pass consensus resolution on Afghanistan
    A Soviet general has named four men as the major figures responsible for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. They include Yuri Andropov, the former KGB chief who later served for a brief term as Soviet leader.
    Former leader Leonid Brezhnev, former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, former Defence minister Dmitri Ustinov and Mr. Andropov were the main officials behind the December 1979 invasion, General Kim Tsagfolov said in the latest edition of the theoretical weekly 'Argumenty-i-Fakty.’
    The first three have been linked previously to the decision to send the Red Army into Afghanistan. But it was the first time Mr. Andropov, KGB chief until 1982 and widely considered spiritual predecessor of the current reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev, had been named
    Other, lower-ranking officials also played a part in the "Afghan Adventure" Gen. Tsagfolov said, although "many now say they were against it."
    Separately, Aleksandr Dzasokhov, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee on International Affairs, has called for a detailed account of the decisions underlying the invasion to be made public at the end of this month of early in November.
    He made the call in Sunday’s edition of the Communist Party daily Pravda.
                                                                                            Commander killed on Salang highway
    Qari Kamaluddin, Jami'at commander in Salang, was martyred on October 1 in combat with the communist forces.
    He was a brave commander who had scored many gains against the Russian and communist forces in the past ten years.
    See obituary on page (3)
     The stage for passing a consensus resolution on Afghanistan, similar to last year's resolution, has been set at the UN General Assembly in New York.
     At the end of the current month or the beginning of next month, the resolution will be put to vote without debate.
     Pakistan has been struggling to get such a resolution. Senior Minister Nusrat Bhutto and Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan were in New York to take part in discussions of the session of the General Assembly.
     A meeting of foreign ministers of the Islamic countries in New York called for intra-Afghan dialogue to form a broad-based’government in Kabul.
     Pakistan's delegation asked for transfer of power to a broad-based government
     The US foreign minister told the general assembly that peace will come with the transfer of power, not by sharing it.
     The Soviet foreign minister called the Afghan problem an internal issue. The foreign minister of the Kabul regime accused Pakistan of violating the Geneva Accords, which was rejected by Pakistan's representative.
     It is reported that Pakistan and Soviet Union have agreed on a consensus resolution calling for a braod-bascd government in Afghanistan, the right of Afghans to determine their future and the return of refugees in honor and safety.
     The Islamic Interim Government has sent a five member delegation to New York to lobby for the Afghan seat in the UN.
     The delegation is headed by Maulawi Younus Khalis and its members are Farooq Azam, Mohammad Yasar, Engineer Rahim and Sulaiman Shah.
     The Afghan seat in the UN is occupied by the Kabul regime. Meanwhile the UN Secretary General, Javier Perez
 de Cuellar, has talked of fresh ideas which will lead to a solution of the Afghan problem. But no detail of these thoughts has been made public yet.
     While the Mujahideen accept the general terms of the consensus resolution, their interpretation of a broad-based government excludes the Kabul regime.
 70,000 refugees enter Pakistan in eight months
     As many as 70,000 Afghan refugees have crossed the Pak-Afghan border into Pakistan during the last eight months.
     A high-level meeting of voluntary agencies was told in Peshawar last week that more assistance would be required to feed the new refugees.
     The Acting Commissioner, Mr. Saeed Ahmad Akhtar, who chaired the meeting stressed the need for more assistance for the Afghan refugees in the NWFP. He said that the problem has not been solved with the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan.
     A UN convoy of food and other essential commodities has started its journey towards Afghanistan through the Soviet Union.
     The relief goods, worth $750,000, are donated by Finland, and die transportation cost is paid by the USSR.
     Since the goods reach Afghanistan through the Soviet Union, the Mujahideen may not allow its distribution in the liberated areas. The goods have to be distributed in cities controlled by the Kabul regime.
     The convoy will reach Afghanistan just before the winter. There is no agreement between the Mujahideen and the UN for the free passage of the goods from Kabul to their destinations inside Afghanistan.

                                From the battlefields
                                                 Parwan province
    The Mujahideen's coordinated operation from southern Salang to Bagram Air Base continues, and the Salang highway remains blocked, according to a message from Commander Ahmad Shah Masood on October 5.
    The operations began on October 2. In the first three days. Mujahideen destroyed two outposts near the Bagram air base, setting on fire two tanks and three trucks. 25 five enemy troops were killed or wounded in those posts.
    In Jangal Bagh, near Parwan's provincial capital of Charikar, eight vehicles, including tanks and armored cars, were destroyed. Two more trucks were set on fire in Matak, near Jabal Seraj.
    Enemy troops in Qala-i-Surkh (the Red Fort), in Jabal Seraj, suffered heavy casualties because of Mujahideen’s artillery bombardment. Details of the casualties are not available yet, however.
    In Orati of Salang, Mujahideen destroyed five military trucks and two tanks. They captured four out posts and set fire to enemy bases in Olang and Ahangaran. A total of 40 enemy troops were killed in Salang.
    Mujahideen casualties included the martyrdom of a great commander. He was Qari Kamaluddin, the General Commander of Salang. Two other Mujahideen were martyred along with him.
    Commander Masood's report adds that in retaliation to Mujahideen attacks, the regime artillery heavily bombarded residential areas, killing and wounding a number of civilians.
                                                  Kabul province
    Commander Anwar Khan said that Mujahideen pushed back a severe onslaught of the Kabul regime aimed at
 reopening the Jalalabad-Soroobi highway on October 6. Scud and Oragan missiles fell and airborne fighters dropped bombs along the highway. Two tanks were burned when they tried to pass the road in the vicinity of Sorobi Hydropower Station.
    Following the defeat of the regime attempt to opening the highway, Antonov transport planes carried Supplies from the capital to Jalalabad at night after 8 p.m.
    The Jalalabad-Soroobi highway has been closed to traffic since September 24 despite regime attempts to reopen it.
   Copter crash kills 26 north of Kabul
    An Afghan government MI-8 helicopter carrying civilians, including women and children, crashed and burned north of the capital on September 25.
    Hospital sources in Kabul said 26 people were killed in the crash, including soldiers.
    "The helicopter may have been carrying a West German television crew on its way to Kabul from the Bagram Air Force Base, 50 kilometers of the Capital, when it crashed because of technical reasons," a regime spokesman said.
                                                 used for high-altitude bombing
    The Kabul regime has upgraded transport planes for use against Mujahideen positions as high-altitude bombers, said a regime pilot who has defected to the Mujahideen recently.
    Lieutenant Ghulam Ghous, 21, said that Kabul regime has turned 36 AN-32 transport planes into high-altitude bombers by attaching special equipment for delivering bombs. Likewise, 24 AN-12 transport planes have been converted to bombers. Each plane can carry 36 bombs weighing 250 kilograms each. These planes' advantage lies in their high-altitude bombing capability. They can bomb from an altitude 9000 meters.
    Ghulam Ghaus said that these planes are equipped with a flare delivery system which is used to mislead heatseeking missiles. The plane can fire up to eight flares per second..
    He said that after the Soviet withdrawal, 20 transport planes of L-76MP landed in Kabul each day. Each plane can cany up to 36 tons of goods. Two Scud missiles can be transported in one such plane.
    Ghulam Ghaus, who served as a pilot of a transport plane, said that pilots are happy to go to western Afghanistan, where they can smuggle drags and transport merchants who give money to the pilots, providing a good source of income.
    He said that the Soviets had three AN-26 reconnaissance planes working in conjunction with the Soviet satellite system. One of them crashed near Bagram, another in Zabul. The last one, which bore the number 11, returned to the Soviet Union.
    The defecting pilot said that he saw a transport plane, flown by one Abdur Rauf, hit by a mortar shell at Khost airport, killing four people on board and damaging the plane.
  Scud missiles land in Pakistan
  • Two Scud missiles fired by the Kabul regime landed in South Waziristan on October 1, but caused no casualties. The missiles landed about eight kilometers from Miianshah town.
    Pakistan's Foreign Office filed a strong protest with Najibullah's regime over the incident. Complaints also have been lodged with the UN observers' team, UNGOMAP, which monitors violations of the Geneva Accords.
    A Scud missile costs one million dollars. They were given to the Kabul regime, after the Soviet troop withdrawal, to boost its military strength. Mujahideen have reported that the missiles are manned and fired by Soviet advisors. Scud missiles have a range of more than 300 kilometers and deliver a charge of 1,000 kilograms.

 Obituary
Com. Qari Kamaluddin
     Kamaluddin, son of Fakhruddin, was bom 35 years ago in Khench village in Panjshir.
     His father was a merchant who wanted his son to study Islam. Kamaluddin attended Madrasa and memorized half of the Holy Quran, and got the title of Qari (one who has memorized the Quran). He attended school up to the sixth class.
     Qari Kamaluddin spent most of his life in Panjshir, except for a short while when he lived in Puli-Khumri town of Baghlan province.
     When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, Qari joined. the Mujahideen. He showed his talent in fighting and leadership and very soon was appointed the deputy commander of a mobile unit. His unit inflicted a crushing defeat on regime forces in Gulbahar (at the mouth of the Panjshir valley) in 1981.
     He served as the local commander of Khench for a while, and then was transferred to lead the Mujahideen in the war against the enemy in Kuran-o-Munjan. Despite his personal courage he was not successful in Capturing Kuran garrison.
     For nine months he helped the Mujahideen from Jami'at in different parts of Badakhshan to re-organize.
     . During the famous seventh offensive against Panjshir in 1984, he entered the valley and engaged the enemy commandos in different places. He lost 12 of his men in these fighting but inflicted heavier losses on the enemy. He was wounded twice.
     Qari Kamaluddin was appointed the commander of Dara sub-district, which had strategic importance for the Mujahideen. -
     The enemy had succeeded in buying off a local, person, Malik Jalal. When the Soviets launched an attack against Dara in the fall of 1984, a group of militiamen were brought to the upper part of Dara valley to establish a tribal battalion. If the enemy plan had succeeded, this base, with the help of Colonel Sarwar in neighboring Nooristan, could have created severe problems for Masood.
     Qari faced a difficult task. He was able to cut the road between the Soviet base in Keraman and the militia groups in Astana, then attacked the militiamen after crossing the snow covered mountain. The enemy was defeated.
     Qari suffered personally during his assignment in Dara: his wife, two children and his sister were killed in an aer-
 ial bombardment.
    Commander Kamaluddin had the honor of leading the Mujahideen in decisive fighting against the enemy garrison in Tanbana in the spring of 1988. More than 400 enemy soldiers were killed or captured and a large quantity of arms were captured. After this defeat the enemy was forced to leave the valley.
    He was assigned another important mission in the strategically important.
    Salang valley, though which the famous Salang highway passes. First he crushed the militia groups on both sides of the highway. At the beginning of the current year he blocked the road for the enemy military convoys for two months; captured 700 soldiers and officers, and seized more than 1000 guns.
    Recently he was told to launch fresh operations, and he successfully annihilated several posts in Salang and blocked the road.
    On October first he was killed along with two Mujahideen after he had overrun one of the enemy posts. He has left behind two children. He will long be remembered for his services, and his death is a great loss to the Mujahideen.
   Ranking Kabul diplomat defects
    Amanullah Nazari, a regime diplomat, has defected to the Mujahideen, MEDIA reported
    The 55-year-old diplomat said that after Najib became the president in 1986, agents of Khad, the regime’s secret police, were sent to Kabul regime missions abroad, posing as diplomats.
    He estimated that 80 percent of the regime’s diplomatic corps are Khad agents.
    Mr. Nazari was the director of studies and research at Kabul’s Ministry of the Foreign Affairs.
                                                First aid used as PR ploy
     The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC ) refused to build hospitals in Mlujafaideen-controlled areas when the Supervisory Council proposed the idea to the visiting delegation of that organization in August.
     A delegation of ICRC visited the North in summer and talked to Com. Masood about the medical and prison-eisof-war issues.
     On the prisoners issue, they wanted to collect data about Soviet POWs and seek their release. They met some Soviet prisoners in the custody of the Supervisory Council who refused to go back to the Soviet Union.
     ICRC offered treatment of wounded Mujahideen at its hospital in Kabul which was rejected. The Mujahideen then asked ICRC to open hospitals in the liberated areas. The delegation said it was unable to respond immediately.
     A representative of ICRC who had participated in Tehran Seminar on Afghanistan told Afghanews that his organization cannot open hospitals in the liberated areas unless they are supplied through Kabul. The Mujahideen do not agree with such an arrangement ICRC's readiness to give first aid to the Mujahideen serves no medical purpose.lt is just a mean of contact with the war fronts.
     The ICRC delegation was carrying radios in order to keep in touch with their Kabul office. The Mujahideen refused to allow this for security reasons.
     ICRC has sent many delegations to liberated areas in Afghanistan, but so far has done no major medical work in Afghanistan. ICRC's only hospital in Afghanistan is in Kabul. In theory it treats all Afghans, but in practice treats only those under control of the regime.
AFGHANews Vol 5, No 20, October 15, 1989, page Q
                                                                We fight to change system, not to replace individuals
     Getting rid of communist rule was the aim of the Mujahideen, who began armed struggle against the Taraki regime before the Soviet invasion, and who fight on to achieve that same goal.
     Armed struggle against oppressive communist rule started two years before the Soviet invasion. Afghans could not accept a bunch of Godless communists to lead them and impose on them the Soviet way of life. After the failure of peaceful means, war became inevitable.
     The Soviet Union, which was behind the communists and supported their programs, saw that the regime was unable to stand against the Afghan people, even though they fought with primitive weapons. The Soviet leaders made the historic mistake of sending the Red Army to save their friends.
     After the Soviet troop withdrawal Afghans were not allowed to determine their future by choosing a system of government suitable to them. The Soviets wanted to impose the regime which they had brought to power in December of 1979. They gave it sophisticated weapons, financial assistance and diplomatic support. A large number of Soviet advisors still help the regime to fight against the Mujahideen.
     During the ten years of Soviet occupation Afghans enjoyed the political and moral support of most of the world. UN, NAM, OIC ancj EEC resolutions called for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the right of Afghans to determine their future. These demands were repeated year after year.
     The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan was an important step, but it did not result in an opportunity for Afghans to determine their own future.
     The continuation of communist rule in Kabul is morally wrong. This regime was brought to power by the Soviet army and played the role of a local guide for the invaders. It does not have the right to lead the freedom-loving people of Afghanistan. Afghans consider Khalqis and Perchamis to be war criminals who should be tried. This is normal treatment for those who join a foreign enemy against their own people. The Communists have permanently disqualified themselves from Afghan politics.
     There are ideological considerations which do not allow the Mujahideen to make peace with communists in Kabul. How could a bunch of Godless communists become leaders of Muslims? On ideological grounds, no Mujahideen party can accept any kind of power-sharing with the communists. One should not be deceived by the recent Islamic appearance of the communists. These are tactical moves to deceive the simple people. High brass of People Democratic Party are staunch unbelievers and'loyal servants of the Soviet Union.
     Giving the communists another chance to play a role in the future of Afghanistan would be a political mistake. The survival of the communists as a political force will fulfill the purpose of the Soviet invasion. They could not achieve it militarily. We should not allow them to gain it through diplomatic means. Any deal with the Kabul regime, a tool of a neighboring superpower, will make permanent the Soviet interference in Afghan internal affairs.
     Therefore, dismantling the Kabul regime is the only way to final victory and return of peace. When we talk about dismantling the regime we don't intend killing all who supported the regime. We are against the system. If the Khad, the police and the army of the communist regime are dismantled, the majority of its members can live a normal life under a new system chosen by the people.
     Some circles propose that Najib resign as a step towards achieving peace. We believe that change of leadership does not resolve the issue. Soviets changed the leadership of the PDPA several times during the years of occupation but the regime did not become acceptable to the majority of Afghans.
     The Mujahideen are fully aware of the danger of survival of the regime under
 any name. They are determined not lay down arms until the final victory is achieved. This is not an easy choice but the consequences of compromise with the regime are more dangerous.
    The demand of some countries, during the 44th General Assembly of the United Nations, that the solution to Afghan conflict lies in transferring power from Najib to a representative government, is a reflection of the true situation. Scud missiles, 40 plane-loads of weapons per day, the presence of thousand of Soviet advisors, cross-border operations and shelling Mujahideen positions cannot gain the regime popular support
    The Soviet Union should not get the wrong impression from the regime's survival, for a few months, and from the hesitation of some foreign countries to support the Mujahideen. The present stalemate is gradually changing in favor of the Mujahideen. Hesitation on the part of some supporters of the Mujahideen will not decide the future of the war. The war started without outside support and can continue without it.
    The previous Soviet leaders made the mistake of supporting a bunch of criminals, who did not hesitate to kill thousands of their people in their lust for power. The present leadership is repeating this mistake. The "new thinking" of Soviet leaders has not found its way into the Soviets’ Afghan policy.
                                                Bhutto reaffirms support for AIG, rejects TV remark
    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, on returning from a state visit to Bangladesh, rejected the remarks of a BBC television documentary that she had asked the Mujahideen to start a dialogue with the Kabul regime.
    She added that her government will give every support to the AIG short of recognition, noting that there are certain international norms and criteria which the AIG should meet before being recognized.
    She stressed the need for broadening the base of the AIG by introducing other Mujahideen groups, Afghan personalities in exile, good Muslims and field commanders.
    During her visit to Bangladesh, the prime minister had said that the hardliners in Kabul should step down to pave the way for formation of a broad-based government.

                                               Jami'at runs 45 jrimary schools in Herat area
    The Mujahideen have opened 45 primary schools in Herat, in which 10,000 children study, said jhulam Nasir, the Deputy lead of the Education Committee of Herat province.
    Ghulam Nasir, 25, is a graduate of Enjeel High School. He has been helping Ismail Khan since 1981.
    Nasir, who recently visited Peshawar, told Afghanews that/nost of the schools were opened in Ghooryan, Zindajan, Obe and Enjeel districts three years ago, with the help of the Education Committee of Alliance.
    He added that the Mujahideen have opened a school for girls, in Ghooryan district, in which 50 students study.
    "The major problem for us is transportation of books, because of the long distance between Peshawar and Herat," Nasir said.
    He said the students did not have enough textbooks, notebooks and pens. Another problem, he added, was lack of professional teachers. He urged educated people to return to the area and teach children.
    Nasir said that more schools were needed. "If we are helped, we will be able to open 50 more schools in different parts of Herat,'1 he said.
Kabul regime a burden on struggling Soviet economy

 of bombing. One Mujahid was killed and the camp's kitchen was destroyed.
    I spent the night with one of the teachers of the Training Center who is my relative.
    Next to the training camp was a workshop for automobiles. Many trucks and armored cars were parked there.
    Halfway between Farkhar and Worsaj the Mujahideen had built a good hospital. I saw many people going to the hospital to have their children treated.
    In Farkhar 1 got diarrhea which continued to bother me during mytrip. The rest of the Mujahideen were suffering from stomach problems too. The problem became acute when I arrived in Taloqan, a city with all sorts of foods. I had a good appetite for food but had to be careful.
     Despite r tremendous economic difficulties, the Soviet Union is spending a huge amount of money to keep the Kabul puppet regime in power.
     According to Soviet Analyst (Vol. 18 No. 17), Gorbachev is facing great economic difficulties. Three hundred towns lack proper sewer drainage. 100 million people (out of a population of 285 million) earn less than £1,200 per annum. Life expectancy in the Soviet Union ranks 32nd in the wolrd.
     With all these problems, Gorbachev still follows the policy of previous leaders in Moscow by imposing unpopular regimes on the people of other countries and providing arms and ammunition to ruthless communists so they can kill their own people.
     After the Soviet troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan the world got the wrong impression: that the Soviet Union's foreign policy had changed.
     Developments showed that this was not correct regarding Afghanistan. The Soviets kept their advisors in Afghanistan, indulged in cross-border operations and gave new and sophisticated weapons to the regime to keep it in power.
     Daily, 40 Soviet transport planes bring arms and ammunition to Kabul, in addition to large convoys sent by road. They have given the regime several hundred Scud missiles; each costs one million US dollars. It is estimated that Soviet aid to the Kabul regime amounts to 300 million dollars per month.
     The Soviet leader decided to take his troops out to .minimize political costs. But by pumping money and weapons into Kabul, he continues to impose the communist regime on the

    Mohammad Younus Qanuni, representative of Commander Masood in the seminar, raised- the issue with Dr. Vilayati, the foreign minister of the Islamic Republic. He promised to discuss the problem with the relevant authorities to find a solution to it.

 people of Afghanistan.
     The communist system is to blame for the misbehavior of its leaders. Based on defiance of God and control of the majority by a minority — the Party — communism requires suppression at home and oppression abroad to survive. New communist leaders blame the previous leaders, but behave the same when dealing with their own people and the rest of the world.
     Fortunately the system has lost its appeal. Signs of its erosion are appearing all over the world.
     The tragedy of the boat people and the invasion of Cambodia are black spots on the history of communism in Vietnam and its supporter, the USSR
     Suppression of the student move? ment in China, civil war and famine in Ethiopia, changes in Poland and Hungary and the exodus of refugees from East Germany to the West are cracks in the armor of communist ideology.
     The Soviet Union, which waged an unsuccessful war of aggression against Afghans for ten years, is facing great economic, ethnic and social problems.
     The people of the Soviet Union have grown unhappy with their limited freedom. The Afghan adventure had a positive effect on this development. The Soviet camp could be called the "sick man of the East."
     A Soviet analyst, looking at the shiny tonnage of a Soviet rocket in Afghanistan, asked his friends: why do the Soviets make such beautiful rockets, but show such poor craftsmanship at making forks and spoons?
     The system is responsible for this unhappy development

From the diary of Jehad
Part (2)
    Jehad brings prosperity and culture to Worsaj fiefdom
      I expected to catch a jeep in Piew. When we arrived were told that a truck belonging to Jami'at had left in the morning. We continued our journey down the green but fruitless valley. The road was in good condition and I was happy to see new houses being built. These building are different from the traditional ones; they have wide windows, large rooms, toilets and bathrooms. In cold areas like Worsaj, traditional houses had small windows and the rooms were dark. As a result of the peoples' travels, their building style has changed.
 We stayed the night with a Panjshiri family who lives as refugees in the upper Worsaj. We were given good food.
 The next day we continued our downward journey with two other friends. They were Daud Mir, an Afghan refugee living in France, and Daud Zahir, one of Masood's communications officers, who also had just come from Pakistan. After six hours of walking we reached Khanaqa, the center of Worsaj sub-district. The shops were full of all sorts of goods. A Mujahid who had stayed in the area for many years told me that die activities of the Supervisory Council had brought a better economic life to the people of the area. People from other areas visit Worsaj for work or on their way to Pakistan. Trade has flourished. Job op--portunities have been created for horsemen in the valley, who transport goods and people back and forth.
      Before the war Worsaj was a kind of fiefdom under control of an influential man called Eshan Nabi. He had close relations with the ex-king, Mohammad Zahir Shah. King Zahir had visited Worsaj once or twice as a guest of Eshan Nabi. The king liked hunting and this interest took him to the beautiful valleys of Farkhar and Worsaj.
      Taraki killed Eshan Nabi. Nabi's son became a refugee in Germany. When the Supervisory Council decided to re-organize the area, the people of Worsaj stepped into a new phase in their lives.
      In Worsaj I saw children going to school, and some young boys were even studying on the bank of the Worsaj River, which is famous for its trout
      In the market we met some people
  By: Mohammad Es'haq
     from the Cultural Committee of the Supervisory Council. They invited us to stay the night with them. I was impressed by the building of the Cultural Committee and its flowers and greenlawns. The people in the committee were kind and hospitable.
     After the evening prayer, the building was lit with electricity produced by a small generator. While the villagers in the rest of the valley were eating by the light of kerosene and diesel lamps, we were enjoying our meal in the electrified building of the Cultural Committee.
     1 thought how pleasant it would be if the Mujahideen could provide electricity for the rest of the population. The people should see that the message of revolution is not just death and destruction. Fighting is necessary to eliminate the enemy, but the work does not end there. After dealing with the enemy, our friends should be supported by providing them with roads, hospitals, schools and electricity.
     I remembered my conversation of two years ago with Commander Masood about these matters. He was thinking about building small power plants to give electricity to the villages. I contacted many organizations who were helping Afghans, but they thought electricity was a luxury and did not help.
 During my stay at the Cultural Committee office I discussed with them issues relating to the publication of their fortnightly paper "Shoora". The article are composed by hand, and the paper is printed with a hand roller.
     What they needed was a computer with an offset machine. They did not have the money to buy the computer, and offset machines cannot be transported on horses because they are too heavy.
     Publishing the paper was a good step but it needed improvement The Mujahideen paper has to compete with the publications of the regime which have shown great improvement lately. The problem with the party-financed papers is that their journalists do not have much freedom to criticize the establishment
     Another problem is the lack of
     trained journalists. Young writers do not differentiate between news and commentary and mix them together without labeling them properly.
     Language is another problem which Afghan journalism faces. There is a tendency among Afghan writers to use highly literary language which is not understood by the ordinary people. I told my colleagues in the Cultural Committee that they should use simple language in reporting in order to let a large number of people understand the contents of their paper. Most of Afghans are illiterate or have only primary education. Flowery language cannot easily be understood. My brothers in the Cultural Committee were polite and hospitable, but later I learned that they were not happy with my direct criticism of their paper.
 There were three new people in the Cultural Committee. They had come from Kabul a few days before we arrived. They had been film actors working for Kabul regime television.
     One of them was a capable film director who had directed three films made in Kabul.. The three had studied at art schools in the Soviet Union. Now they wanted to make films in support of the Afghan struggle for freedom.
     After a day of rest in Worsaj, we continued our journey towards Farkhar. To my surprise most of the trucks on the road were very new and powerful. Most of them had belonged to the regime and were captured by the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen had sold them to the private owners who run transport in the valley. Road conditions had improved. There were a group of people working on the road.
     After two hours of driving we reached the Training Center of the Mujahideen in Khost Deh. The headquarters of tfye Supervisory Council is situated one kilometer further downstream.
     Two years ago no buildings existed in the area. The Center is used to train Mujahideen belonging to the army and to local groups of Jami'at. The training camp has been bombed once. Marks of shrapnel could be seen on the wall and a shard had flown through the window of Commander Masood's room, but he was not there at the time

 A few days in Islamic Iran
     I wanted to visit Iran to see the situation in that country after a decade of war with Iraq. The second seminar on Afghanistan, organized by the Center of International and Strategic Studies, at the foreign ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran, made it possible for me to make the journey.
     I was among 80 people from different Mujahideen groups who flew aboard a special plane to Tehran. Prof, Rabbani and Prof. Mujaddidi were also in the plane.
     From the airport we were taken by bus to Howaiza Hotel at the center of the city. Prominent guests were lodged at Isdqlal Hotel (Old Hilton).
     The first thing which attracted my attention in the morning was the Islamic dress of the Iranian women. We were having our breakfast in the restaurant of the Hotel from where we could clearly see the street. Men, women and children were going to work or school. Women wore black dresses which covered their whole body except for the face and hands. Women in Iran work in offices and factories, and a large number of girls attend schools and universities. Women are required to wear Islamic dress. For those who had seen the westernized women of Shah's time the achievement of the Islamic Republic was remarkable. The role of women in an Islamic Government is a much debated question. The achievement of the Islamic Republic of Iran can serve as an example for other Islamic countries.
     I wanted to exchange money. One could exchange money in a bank or in the black market which made business along the streets with no restrictions. I preferred the free market but was surprised by the low value of Iranian currency.
     We were taken to visit the war museum in Niawaran Palace, where the late Shah had his residence and offices. In the Museum, captured Iraqi tanks, helicopters, jets and other weapons were displayed. There were also samples of weapons belonging to different times in history. A former Afghan army officer, now a Mujahid, asked why the Mujahideen were not preserving captured Russian weapons to enrich our future war museum.
     On the second day of our visit we were taken to a handicraft museum, where men and women wove carpets, painted miniatures and made fine pottery. We were impressed by the skills
                                    By: Mohammad Es’haq
 of the Iranian craftsmen.
     In the afternoon we were taken to Imam Khomeini's tomb, where Professor Mujaddidi laid a floral wreath and prayed for the soul of the Imam. The Imam is buried about 20 kilometers outside of Tehran and a huge complex is being built around his tomb. The complex will include a religious educational institution, a hospital and a mosque. The complex covers an area of more than 100 hectares of land, and will cost two billion US dollars, to be donated by the people. Love for the late Imam is a dominating factor in Iranians' lives.
     The second seminar on Afghanistan was held in a building belonging to the foreign ministry of Iran in the northern part of the city of Tehran. The venue of the seminar was prepared for about 200 people while 800 people attended the seminar. The presence of so many people had a negative affect on the arrangement for food and congregational prayers.
     Despite lengthy talk about unity between Sunni and Shia, the congregational prayers were not attended by the followers both sects at the same time.
     Dr. Velayati, the foreign minister of the Islamic Republic, gave a reception for seminar participants in one of the gardens in Tehran. The atmosphere was friendly; the food was delicious and the weather was very nice.
     A large group of Afghans, wearing traditional clothes and traveling back and forth in buses escorted by police cars, was an attractive sight for the residents of Tehran.
     Iranian officials were very careful in their remarks about the role of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and their warning to the Mujahideen about possible American interference was wrapped in diplomatic words. Indirect reference to the Soviet Union was a sign of closer ties between Tehran and Moscow after Imam Khomeini's death.
     Scholars attending the conference believed that there was no military solution to Afghan problem. They warned that the AIG had a limited amount of time to prove its credibility, if a solution is not to be imposed on Afghans from outside.
     In the original program there were four papers on Loya Jirga (the traditional Afghan assembly), but these were omitted due to an ugly incident.
     A French scholar read out a paper
 about nationalities in Afghanistan and mentioned some local alliance between some parties. The representative of Shura-e-Ittifaq (a Shia group out of eighth-party coalition) became angry and started to make a scene by shouting anti-French slogans. Later it was understood that his reaction was based on a misunderstanding and the French scholar had not said anything offensive against Shura.
     Papers about Loya Jirga and Zahir Shah, being controversial, were omitted to avoid further misunderstandings.
     During our stay in Tehran, some Mujahideen saw that the Kabul regime's flag was hoisted among other flags in front of Istiqlal Hotel. They resented it, and were thinking of displaying a reaction. They were advised by their elders not to do anything which would hurt their Iranian hosts. Later we heard that a Kabul-regime delegation attending a UN-sponsored seminar was staying in the same hotel as the Mujahideen leaders. That was the reason for hoisting the regime flag.
     The Islamic Republic does not recognize the communist regime in Kabul, but has not closed its embassy there; and the Kabul has an embassy in Tehran.
     During my stay in Tehran I visited one of the editors of Kaihan Hawaii (a weekly paper). This meeting turned out to be very informative. He described the difficulties of journalism in the Islamic Republic. One of these was a shortage of paper. He showed a readiness to reflect in his paper Afghans' views on different issues regarding their struggle.
     He said that defeating the enemy is much easier then reconstruction of the country. I thought that if Iran is facing problems despite having a central government, a united leadership and oil-wells, how great would be our difficulties: we have none of these at the moment.
     At the end of the seminar I visited the bookshops near the famous Tehran University. Iran has many good things, but the best are the books which Iranian scholars have written or translated. Afghans rely a great deal on books printed in Iran because Iranians and many Afghans speak the same language. Unfortunately, due to paper shortages or some other considerations, taking books out of Iran requires a special permit from the Ministry of

    Prof. Rabbani, Jami'at leader, held extensive talks inside Afghanistan with Com. Ahmad Shah Masood in the last week of September.
    Masood was visiting Badakhshan province, near the border with Pakistan, when the meeting took place. It was a good opportunity for both leaders to discuss the military and political situation in Afghanistan.
    In addition to Prof. Rabbani a group of Jami'at officers working for the Supervisory Council also met with Com. Masood.
    The meeting took place in Top Khana, a garrison evacuated last year by the Soviet troops.
    One day after the meeting, the area was heavily bombed by enemy planes, but there were no casualties.
    This was the second meeting between Prof. Rabbani and Commander Masood within one year.
Second Seminar on Afghanistan studies ways of achieving peace
                                           USSR appoints new envoy to Kabul mission
    Moscow has appointed Boris Pastukhov the new Soviet Ambassador to Kabul, the Soviet News Agency Tasshas reported.
    He will replace Yuli Vorontsov, the first Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was appointed as Soviet ambassador to Kabul in Octoberl988.
    Mr. Pastukhov has served as First Secretary of Komsomol, the Communist Youth Organization; and as president of the State Committee of Publishing. He undertook his first diplomatic post when he was appointed Ambassador to Denmark in 1986.
                                           Kabul regime pilot defects
    Major Jalaluddin landed his MIG-21 fighter in Peshawar on September 29, seeking asylum.
    He was on a bombing mission against the Mujahideen in Sorobi, on the Kabul-Jalalabad highway, when he defected
    Later he told a press conference in Islamabad that Soviet pilots were still involved in operations against the Mujahideen.
     The second seminar on Afghanistan ended in Tehran on October 4, after three days of deliberation on the political and military situation in Afghanistan.
     The seminar was arranged by the Institute of International and Strategic Studies of the Foreign Ministry of Iran on the theme "An Independent Islamic and Non-Aligned Afghanistan".
     Eight hundred scholars, political leaders of the Afghan Resistance, leaders of some Islamic movements and Mujahideen commanders participated in the seminar.
     The seminar was opened by reading the message of President Rafsanjani in which he asked for a broad-based government in Afghanistan in which all groups and sections of the Afghan people should lake part.
     Dr. Velayati, the foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was the first speaker. He assured the Afghan people of Iran's continuous support.
     In three days, 28 papers were read by scholars and Mujahideen leaders. The papers discussed the political, economic and military situation in Afghanistan, and ways of achieving peace in that war-tom country.
     Prof. Mujaddidi, the President of the Interim Government, asked for recognition of die interim government by the Islamic countries and rejected the possibility of any dialogue with the communist regime of Najibullah.
     Mohaqqiq, the spokesman of the eight-party coalition based in Iran, asked for broadening the base of the interim government to make it acceptable to the coalidon.
     Prof. Rabbani, Jami'at leader, and the leaders of Mujahideen independent groups also spoke.
     All Mujahideen leaders rejected any future role for the communist regime and asked for unity among Afghans.
     Scholars and experts from Pakistan, Iran, Lebanon, Turkey, Austria, France, West Germany and the U.K. also participated in the seminar. Most of them believed that there was no military solution to the problem of Afghanistan. They were of the view that the Mujahideen's poor performance in the battlefield is due to lack of unity. Some were in favor of talks between Mujahideen and people working in the Kabul administration. The Mujahideen, however, strongly rejected the any deal with the communist regime.
     In the opening session some diplomats, Walid Jumblat, leader of Lebanon's Socialist Party and Nabi Berry, the leader of the Amal party, also participated.
     The leaders of the independent Mujahideen parties, who have close ties with Tehran, and representatives of some Islamic movements, warned against American interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. They went so far in emphasizing the danger of American involvement in Afghanistan that they rarely mentioned the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union in ten years of occupation.
     Participation of a considerable number of Afghan women in the seminar was also a new development Some of these women had gone from Peshawar while the rest came from among the refugees living in Iran. Women speakers emphasized the role of Afghan women in Jehad and reconstruction in Afghanistan.
     Though the seminar was designed to let scholars debate the issue and propose solutions, the presence of so many Afghan leaders. Mujahideen commanders and members of.Islamic movements gave it a political color.
     The participants, especially the Mujahideen leaders, met with President Rafsanjani and Dr. Velayati to discuss the latest situation with them.
     The Iranian leaders asked the Mujahideen to unite their ranks because unity was the only way to victory and peace.
     After meeting Rafsanjani, Professor Mujaddidi and Mohaqqiq promised to re-start dialogue to find a formula to enable the eight-party coalition join the Interim Government
     Mohammad Younus Qanuni spoke in the seminar as the representative of Ahmad Shah Masood. He stressed the need for escalation of the war and said that it was the only way of achieving peace. He asked commanders to forge practical unity among themselves; the political leaders to support war efforts, and the friendly countries to assist the Mujahideen in their struggle for self-determination.
  ICRC criticized
   Amin Wardak, famous commander of Wardak told MIDI A that ICRC delegation under the cover of meeting wounded Afghans, was searching for Russian prisoners
