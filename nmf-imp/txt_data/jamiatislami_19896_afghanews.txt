Regime convenes 'Loya Jirga'
Najib runs out of political initiatives
    Recent fighting has left scenes of devastation that goes >eyond what Westerners have previously know about the conflict , writes John F. Bums, a New York Times correspondent who travelled under the protection of the regime to the Salang valley 80 kilometers north of Kabul.
    The reporter counted in one 12-mile stretch north of the garrison town of Jabul Seraj 157 trucks smashed where they were hit by the Muslim guerrillas' rocket and machinegun fire. Many of the wrecks were tankers carrying fuel from a railhead town near the Soviet border, 250 Miles north of Kabul.
    "But the twisted and blackened metal that litters the roadside, and a large number of tanks and trucks that have been blasted off the road into the
                                                                                                              Turn to page ( 5 )
     A two-day "Loya Jirga" convened by the regime ended in Kabul after extending the emergency situation for six months.
     Loya Jirga { Grand Assembly) takes its name from a traditional gathering of elders and dignitaries in Afghanistan to discuss issues of national importance. The communist regime, using the name of Jirga, has convened several meetings of its supporters to gain legitimacy.
     In an 80-minute speech in the Opening session, Najib repeated what he has said in the past He accused Pakistan of interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, offered a ceasefire and asked for the formation of a 3-member delegation to negotiate with the opposition and King Zahir Shah.
     He threatened Pakistan with rocket attacks against refugees camps if it continued to support the Mujahideen.
     Najib said that if die commanders agreed to stop fighting, his government would give them material assistance
         Peshawar talks make no progress
     The nine-day long talks between delegates of the Interim Government of the Mujahideen and Iran-based Coalition ended without making any progress on the issue of representation of the Shia parties in the cabinet of the Interim government.
     But the two sides agreed to form a six-member committee, three from each side, to continue consultation.
     At the end of Prof. Rabbani's trip to Iran the two sides had agreed that a delegation of the eight-party coalition would visit Pakistan to hold further talks. Karim Khalili arrived in Pakistan on May 17 at the head of a four-member delegation.
     The delegation met with the
President of the Interim Government, Profit Mujaddidi, Prime Minister Sayyaf and other leaders of the Mujahideen.
    Five rounds of formal talks were held between the two side. The negotiating team of the interim government included Prof. Rabbani, Jami'at leader, Nabi Mohammadi, Harakat Inqilab Chief, Engineer Ahmad Shah, Ali Ansari and Farooq Aazam.
    The central issues in the talks were the number of ministerial seats for the Iran-based Coalition and other related problems. The Interim Government had agreed to give five ministerial seats in a 28-member cabinet to the eight-party
                                                                                                               Turn to page ( 2 )
 and military rank with all privileges. In other words, he wants the commanders to become his militiamen.
     He claimed that in Nooristan and Bamyan the self-government program was operating with the assistance of the regime. He was referring to the deal the regime had made with Colonel Sarwar in western Nooristan and Sayed Mansoor of the Ismailia community in Kayan, Bamyan.
     Sarwar was driven out of Nooristan two years ago because his connection with the government was revealed to the ordinary Nooristanis. Sayed Mansoor of Kayan oily controls the areas inhabited by the Ismailia community.
     The Jirga extended the emergency situation announced after Soviet withdrawal for six months. Najib had chosen the delegates in the Jirga from among his supporters. They came from the cities controlled by the regime.
     The regime controls less than 20% of Afghan territory and only a fraction of the country's population. There are more than five million refugees living outside Afghanistan.
     The situation in Afghanistan does not permit real gatherings of elders. Therefore, convening such a meeting under the traditional name of Jirga does not give it legitimacy.
     Invitation letters woe sent to field commanders toparticipate inthe Jirga, but no significant Mujahideen figures attended the meeting.
     The interim government of the Mujahideen called the Kabul Jirga a political ploy.
     Observers believe that Najib's political initiatives have failed to produce positive results. The regime has no choice other than adopting hardline policies in the form of military activities. The decision of the Jirga to extend the emergency indicates the direction in which the situation will develop in the near future.

  Editorial
                               We are sure of Mujahideen's victory
     Development since the Soviet withdrawal ace a source of concern to some supporters of Mujahideen outside Afghanistan. They expected a quick victojv. Jalalabad operation had generated a lot of expectations. The way its propaganda side was handled gave the impression of an easy victory.
     Some Mujahideen circles who also expected a quick victocy over the regime brces share the same concern but a great number of commanders were not surprised by the course of developments. These commanders had warned about possi-)le tough resistance by the enemy and the unpreparedness of the Mujahideen to exploit the shock that the regime forces were supposed to experience from Soviet withdrawal.
     The Mujahideen, who were fighting a defensive mobile war, were not able to re-organize themselves quickly to fight a conventional war.
     Normally, it takes years for guerrilla groups to move from one phase of war to another-from a defensive war to an offensive.
     In Afghanistan, Soviet forces left before the resistance had reached a higher degree of organization development
     The Mujahideen need to take the proper steps to reach the stage of launching offensive attacks on a large scale against major enemy targets.
     Jami'at commanders are evolving a strategy to reach that stage of the war in the shortest possible time. Formation of a guerrilla army and adoption of large scale mobile warfare are the essential ingredients of this strategy.
     Primary work for the implementation of this strategy has already begun. Jami’at has the experience, organizational ability and vision to take the lead.
     Our enemy has many weak points which , if exploited properly could lead to its destruction. It does not have enough manpower to move to an offensive war. It does not have the support of Afghan people. Its logistics lines are vulnerable. It depends on supplies from the Soviet Union. It can't fight the war on its own terms because of the little territory it controls and hostile population it is surrounded by.
     All these weaknesses cannot bring the regime to its knees by themselves unless they are exploited wisely and quickly * because-weaknesses may not be permanent
     The Miijaliideen have to make full use of their time, favorable environment, outside support/enough manpower and a popular cause to improve their performance in the shortest possible time.
     The Mujahideen leadership have been busy with non-military issues since Soviest left High expectations forced the Mujahideen political leadership to think more about running Afghanistan after liberation than about winning the war. Formation of the interim government and dealing with the problems arising from it, negotiations between Peshawar-based and Teheran-based Alliance, etc. have drawn attention from the battlefield and resulted in a low level of military activities aU over Afghanistan.
     It is wise to think about the future but the immediate future most be dealt with first The first priority is winning the war. Our leadership should concentrate on this issue.
     We believe in the final victory of the Afghan people. The quicker this victory is the less they will suffer: A quick victory does not come through wishful thinking. It comes through organized work, unity among the resistance forces and adoption of a workable strategy.
     . Individual parties may not have all the elements that bring victory in but collective action of all will solve the difficulties.

    Regime calls atrocity victory
    The regime has been able to feed the Salang atrocity against civilians as a major military victory against Mujahideen to the Western media.
    The regime claims that Salang operation launched by Soviet and regime forces some weeks before the Soviet withdrawal was a major blow to the Mujahideen.
    The Soviets launched massive air and ground attacks against the villages controlled by the Mujahideen in Salang valley prior to the completion of their troop withdrawal on February 15. About 800 people, mainly civilians, were killed, all the villages on both sides of the road were razed to the ground by artillery fire and aerial carpet bombing.
    The regime fired more than 20 Scud missiles into Panjshir and other valleys close to the Salang valley.
    The Mujahideen had no plan to attack leaving Soviet troops. Therefore, that operation could be justified as a defensive measure. It was a major operation against the civilians in the area and cannot be tamed a 'major victory' for the regime.
    After February 15, the Mujahideen brought a section of road under their control For two months the Mujahideen allowed only food convoys to pa<^ and the road was blocked for militarv convoys.
    In two months a large number of soldiers were captured by the Mujahideen or defected to them, and about 1000 light and heavy weapons were seized, in addition to large quantities of food and ammunition.
    How can one call, the atrocity in Salang and post-withdrawal developments there a victory for the communists? It was a disaster for them.
    Some visiting journalists who did not have background information about the events fell into the trap of the regime and Soviet propaganda and falsely called an atrocity against civilians a 'major military victory1 for the regime.

Who is who in the Mujahideen
Com.Sayed Sher Ali
     Commander Sayed Sher Ali, a wrestler, horse rider, hunter and mechanic, was bom 38 years ago in a family with a rich anti-Russian background
     His father Haji Qurban was 15 years old when he escaped from central Asia along with his family. His grandfather was a Tajik Mujahid who fought for 13 years against the Soviets to liberate Tajikistan. "His grandfather was a gunsmith who escaped from Bukhara, crossed Amu Darya in the middle of a horrible night and lost two children in the wild waves of the river before he arrived in Takhar. The Afghan government arrested him to please the new Soviet government,n said his cousin, now living in Peshawar. "The Government of Afghanistan thought he was the legendary Ebrahim Beg, the leader of anti-Soviet Movement in Bukhara," said his cousin.
     His father, now 80 years old, is still helping his son. His father has been a source of. encouragement to Shef Ali.
     "Commander Sher Ali started the fighting with the same gun that his grandfather fought the Russians with," remarked his cousin.
     Commander Sher Ali went to school and studied up to fifth ^grade to learn how to read and write. Then he worked in his father's small dark workshop to make money, to learn how to repair guns and to help his father.
     "Early in the morning Sher Ali was among a band of wrestlers practicing to become a champion in wrestling," said his representative in Peshawar. "He was indeed a strong man." Sher AH's family decided to go to Ptd-e-Khumri where they could open
 e-Ghori, where 16 communists were killed or wounded and two captured. His Mujahideen seized 20 weapons. The sub-district was liberated and Mujahideen moved into the town and started to work among the people. In a small council held in 1979, Mujahideen elected Sher Ali as Pule-Khumri district commander. In 1980 they all joined Jami'at I si ami Afghanistan.
     In the past nine years, Sher Ali has participated in many small and big operations against the Soviets and the communist regime. His operations in 1985 and 1986 woe the most successful ones. In a defensive operation commanded by Sher Air more than 100 Russian and puppet regime soldiers were killed or wounded, a dozen tanks were destroyed and a lot of weapons were seized Mujahideen lost eight men. In the fall of 1986 he launched an operation against government posts located at Surkh Kotal, in which Sher All's Mujahideen destroyed four government post and captured 60 militiamen.
     Commando- Sher Ali has good re-jations with the Supervisory Council of the North through Commander Mullah Shams from Baghlan city. His relations with other Mujahideen parties are also good
     He has built three Madrasas in the last five years. He has created a Council of commanders and Ulema to deal with day to day problems.
     Commander Sher Ali is well respected by the people. He has lost one brother who was his group commander in the war. He is married and has seven children..
       TwoShia groups decide to end hostility
    After two rounds of talks between Shoora Ittifaq Afghanistan and the eight-party Coalition the two sides agreed to avoid internal clashes and strengthen the joint armed struggle against the Kabul regime to establish an Islamic system.
    They also agreed to send a high level delegation to Afghanistan to create consensus among groups and to prevent internal tension.
    The agreement was signed by Ali Jan Zatudi from Eight-party Coalition and Ali Mehdavi from Shoora.
    Some of the radical parties in the Coalition, especially Nasre, had severe difficulties with Shoora Ittifaq, which is a traditional party. These differences sometimes led to clashes over the control of territory. Shoora has remained out of Coalition because of the opposi don of the radical groups to its entry.

Unprecedented destruction in Salang
From Page (1)
     When die communists took oyer, Sher AK was stiU working in the workshop. His father was the first who encouraged his son to take part in the antt-communlst battle: His father provided him and his first 20 companions with guns and ammunition.
     They were the same guns that they had brought with them from Bukhara. At the beginning, Sher Ali had the support of his relatives in the armed struggle. He established his base in Dahna-e-Ghori mountains a sub-district of Puli-e^ Khumri in May .1978.
     In a year's time, Sher Ali was able to expand his base and increase the number of his Mujahideen to 90. His first military operation was attacking the communists headquarters in Dahna-
 Salang river,” wrote Mr. Bums, "are little compared to the destruction that Soviet and Afghan troops have wrought above the road. On either side of the gorge that runs through the 15,000-foot mountains are dozens of ancient villages that have been bombed, rocketed, and shelled into oblivion."
     He saw at least 40 villages along the 12-mile stretch to the settlement at Haijan where not a single house was standing.
       An Afghan officer told the correspondent that the devastation of the villages occurred progressively in the 10 years of fighting, as guerrillas occupied the villages and Soviet and Afghan government forces battled to uproot
them.
    But, soldiers who accompanied a group of Western reporters up the Salang highway from Jabul Seraj raid that much of die destruction occurred in the final weeks before February 15, when the Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops from the war. Fearing attacks on its retreating columns by guerrillas hiding in the villages, Soviet commanders approved bombing and artillery barrages against the villages and other potential guerrilla hideouts.
    The account Of this reporter confirms the report of Mujahideen, who earlier reported the event in full detail.

           Eight-Pary Coalition rejects Vorontsov's offer for separate deal
     ban-based Mujahideen resumed talks with the Soviet Union in Tehran but no progress was made.
     Yuri Vorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and Ambassador to Kabul went to Tehran on May 11, to talk about the situation in Afghanistan with Iranian leaders and Mujahideen leaders based in Tehran.
     The Mujahideen delegation which met with Vorontsov was headed by Ali Jan Zahidi, spokesman of the eight parly Alliance.
     Sources close to the Mujahideen say that Vorontsov repeated what he had offered last December when he held talks with the ban-based parties in Tehran for die first time.
     He proposed autonomy for Hazarajat in return for making peace with the Najib government Vorontsov also invited the Mujahideen leaders to travel to Moscow for further talks. Both proposals were rejected by the Mujahideen.
     The first dialogue between the Mujahideen and the Soviets was held in Tail, Saudi Arabia, in November last year. The second round of talks was held in December in Islamabad. Talks did not continue because the Sovietsinsisted on participation of the communist regime in the future government The Soviets held separate talks with ban-based parties in Tehran and Vorontsov met with the ex-king, Mohammad Zahir, in Rome.
     Karim Khalili, who heads a delega-
     Sopervisory Council of the North has expressed hope that the Interim Government of the Mujahideen will hold general elections in the country within six months of its formation in late February.
     This view has been expressed in a circulation of the Supervisory Council printed inside Afghanistan. The paper say that the present Interim Government's shortcomings can be corrected only by participation of Afghans from aU sections of society through general elections.
     The paper lists the short-comings of the interim government as: -Exclusion of ban-based parties -Absence of the majority of field commanders in the consultative Shoora which approved the government
 don of ban-based parties in negotiation with the interim government said that die Soviets insisted on the meeting and the eight-party coalition accepted it Holding separate talks with ban-based Mujahideen is considered a divisive tactic by the Soviets. In the second round of talks in Islamabad the representatives of both Alliances, Peshawar-based and Tehran-based, sat together in die negotiations with die Soviets.
     In his talks with banian leaders Vorontsov accused Pakistan, USA and Saudi Arabia of interfering m the affairs of Afghanistan.
     The banian- foreign minister said that his country opposed interference in the affairs of Afghanistan. He said that Afghans were capable of forming their own government, without outside pressure.
     The Iranian president, Sayed Ali Khaminei, urged Vorontsov to stop helping the communist regime in KabuL
    . Pakistan foreign minister Sahib ZadaYaqoub Khan has stressed theneed for resumption of talks between the Mujahideen and the Soviet Union to find a solution to Afghan problem.
     The Soviets have shown readiness to resume talks but have said that they will hold taflcs after getting permission bom the communist regime in KabuL The Mujahideen rule out the possibility of any form of power sharing with communist regime in Kabul.
     -Equal representation for all the seven parties in die consultative Shoora and the Interim Government while the influence of the parties inside Afghanistan varies considerably.
     The paper says that the Supervisory council of the North endorses the interim government for die sake of the unity of die Mujahideen but feels the need to broaden its base and give representation to the parties according to their strength and popularity.
     According to the paper this could be achieved through general elections something that the government has promised to the people of Afghanistan.
     The paper describes the interim government as a step .to the higher' stage of general elections in Afghanistan,
    Commander Ismail Khan of Herat has sent a message to Jan&'at headquarters in Peshawar rejecting the rumors of a compromise between the Mujahideen in Herat and the communist forces. The following is the translation cf his letter:
        Dear brothers in Islam Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmamllah.
        The unremitting struggle and unprecedented resistance of the heroic Afghan Muslim Mujahideen is quite obvious to the people of die regime and the world. They stood unflinchingly against a superpower and its agents for eleven years.
        At these critical historical moments when the criminal Russians and their atheistic puppet regime face military and political defeat, they have intensified their dirty games to create division among Mujahideen, to defame Mujahideen leaders, and to confuse worid public opinion. They allege compromise and conciliation to the determined and committed commanders of the Islamic revolution-commanders such as heroic Ahmad Shah Masood, heroic Abdul Haq and other believing and faithful warriors. They make allegations arid spread rumors. Unfortunately some international media broadcast their allegations without investigation.
        Though the puppet regime's desperate attempts will prove futile and will not save it from the ultimate downfall clarification of few points in regard toon position seems necessary
        While writing this letter at 4:00 p.m. of Wednesday May 24, 1989, the enemy's severe, barbaric air and artillery bombardment of our strongholds continues. Fighting is going on in different parts of Herat. The puppet regime's supply routes from Torghundi to Herat and bom Herat to Kandahar have been blocked.
        Therefore, we strongly reject and condemn any allegation and accusation of hypocritical compromises and diversionary methods. We assure you all that in the same way we began our Islamic revolution in reliance upon God Almighty, we will end our struggle with the help of God, with the slogan, "Either victory or martyrdom."

election
      Solidarity's victory in the elections in Poland is a source of happiness to the Afghan resistance.
      After a long period of suppression the Solidarity Movement was able to participate in a partially free election and gain victory.
      The communist party which had reserved most of the seats of the lower house for its candidates admitted the solidarity victory in these seats which it was allowed to contest
      It is natural for Afghans to feel close to a movement which sympathized with the Mujahideen in their struggle for liberation.
      There are good reasons for closeness between the Afghan Resistance and the Solidarity Movement. The Soviet Union is their common enemy, both are anti communist movements and are motivated by religious ideals in their struggle.
      Members of the Solidarity movement have looked with admiration at the courage and patience of the Afghans in their long and difficult struggle.
      When the Soviets decided to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan, people affiliated Id Solidarity celebrated the victory of Afghans by sending congratulatory messages to the Mujahideen leaders.
      Jami'at received several letters from solidarity workers addressed to Prof. Rabbani and Commander Masood
      Masood is a known figure in Poland because the account of his struggle has been published in Polish and distributed among Poles by his admirers.
      The Afghans victory is not completed yet and neither is die Solidarity Movement. The initial victories of the two have happened in the same year, a happy coincidence.
                                                                                     passes
    Imam Khomeini, the spiritual leader of Iran died at the age of 86 on June 3.
    Ayatullah Rohullah Khomeini led the Islamic Revolution against the Shah of Iran in 1979 and founded the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    He had inspired millions of Iranians, including youth and women far ten years since the fall of Shah.
    Millions of Iranians gathered to mourn his death. A Mujahideen delegation headed by Prof. Mujaddidi participated in the funeral of the late Imam. Prof. Rabbani, Jami'at leader was included in the Mujahideen delegation.
    The 80-member council of experts elected Sayed Ali Khamenei, the president of Iran, the new spiritual leader of Iran.
    In a message to the newly-elected spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic, Professor Rabbani called the demise of the Imam a great loss for all Muslims. He called the Imam a great man who

Who's who in the Mujahideen
Mawlawi Mohammad Zarif
      Mawlawi Mohammad Zarif was bom 49 years ago in the village of Kuran in the district of Sangcharak, Xawzjan province.
      His father. Mullah Abdul Jamil was a religious man teaching Quran to the people of that village. Mohammad Zarif was six years old when he was sent by his father to the mosque to leant the Quran.
      He learnt the Quran quickly and started the basics of Islamic theology. It took him thirteen years to complete his studies in different madrasas (religious schools). He studied jurisprudence in Balkh, Faryab and Kunduz provinces.
      Mawlawi Zarif, a Tajik, became a teacher and taught in different madrasas in Sangcharak district. He taught jurisprudence and Tafseer( Holy Quran commentry) to his students for fourteen years.
      When the communists took over in 1987, Mawlawi Zarif was a Mudarres (a teacher of religious subjects) in Sangcharak. Mawlawi Zarif left his job and started to move from district to district to warn the people about the danger of communism. He knew most of the communist students when he was a teacher.
      He was active in demonstrations and protests against the communists during the rule the former King and his cousin. President Daud. In the summer of 1978 he formed his own group and attracted the young anti-communists Muslim activists. The first group which took arms were 22 persons out of whom just four are alive now, the rest were martyred. "People such as Qazi Mohammad Sharif, Saifuddin, Mawlawi Sher Ali, Mawlawi Mohammad Sarwar, Mawlawi Esmatullah, Mullah Khairuddin and Abdul Jabar were the first heroes," said his representative in Peshawar.
       "They worked for about one year underground without using arms against the puppet regime. On second April 1979, Mawlawi Zarif ordered his group to launch an attack against the district headquarters in Sangcharak. In a six-hour operation in which 60 Mujahideen participated, Mawlawi Zarif was able to capture the district headquarters. That was the first victory which opened the gate to the future victories,” said his son now living in Peshawar.
       Mawlawi Zarif established his base in Gusfandi valley in the mountains of Sangcharak. The year 1981 was
 a bad time for his Mujahideen. One of his group commanders, Khair Mohammad, joined the regime forces informing the enemy about the Mujahideen activities and their whereabouts. The Russians attacked the Mujahideen and inflicted heavy losses on them.
       In 1982, Mawlawi Zarif was appointed by Prof. Rabbani the administrative head( Amir) of Jawzjan province.
       One of the biggest operations in which he lost his main commander, Ahmad Khan was in the summer of 1985. The operation was launched in cooperation with Mujahideen of Balkh province attacking Zari district
       Mawlawi Zarif has established a council of Ulema to act as the judicial committee.
       He is keen to keep the doors of the madrasas open. He still teaches if he finds the time to do so.
       His relations with others parties in the area are good. "Since Jami'at is dominant in the area, he has no problem with other parties." Last year when commander Khalil Khan of Balkh was sent by commander Masood to assess the strength of Mujahideen in the area of Jawzjan, Mawlawi Zarif welcomed commander Masood's initiatives and assured him of his support.
       He is interested in studying new books on Islam. "Whenever he gets a chance he goes to a quiet comer and reads his books," said his representative.
       He is respected as a teacher and as an honest Muslim. He is married and has six children.
   Afghan war costs Soviets $70 billion
      A Soviet Government official has said that his country spent 70 billion Dollars during the nine years of war in Afghanistan.
      The Soviet have lost thousands of tanks, hundreds of jets and helicopters in addition to heavy casualties among its soldiers which could not be measured by money. In addition to that it gave large quantities of military and non-military supplies to the communist regime in Kabul.
      For a country which is facing shortages of food and other consumer goods the burden of war was unbearable. This was an important reason for the Soviets to leave Afghanistan.
      But the Soviets have committed themselves to support the Kabul regime by giving economic and military aid to it. This means that while they have minimized the political costs still they are spending a lot of money in Afghanistan.
      For a short period of time the costs could be bearable but the Soviets may find themselves unable to bear the costs for long. '
      A BBC correspondent who visited Hairatan port along the Soviet border reported that huge quantities of military and non-military goods had arrived at the town to be transported to Kabul.
      According to the reporter, Kabul and Moscow seemed concerned by the level of expenditure to keep the regime in Kabul.
      The reporter saw long columns of tanks, armored cars, trucks and artillery in the border town.

    Editorial
           ......... - -
                               No stalemate, no need to change policy
     The news media have reported about a possible change in US and Pakistan policy regarding the Afghan problem.
     It is said that Pakistan Government will emphasize more on a political solution of the problem rather than a military option.
     The news of opposition of some members of US Congress to the continuation of arms supply to the Mujahideen are also reported.
     It was predicted that the Afghan issue would be on the top the agenda in discussions between the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the US President
     The reports about the change of Afghan policy came when the efforts of the Mujahideen to liberate Jalalabad did not succeed and the media reported a stalemate military situation in the country.
     The situation in Jalalabad and the fact that four months after the Soviet Hoops withdrawal the Mujahideen did not achieve a major military victory has given credit (o this view that die Mujahideen are hot able to defeat the Kabul regime militarily. Therefore, a political solution must be sought to end the crisis.
     The idea of a political solution to the problem is very old. Both sides of the conflict have stated their desire to find a political solution but the interpretation of each side from a political solution is different.
     To the Mujahideen, a political solution means transfer of power from the communist regime to a broad-based government which the Mujahideen are the principle part of. This government will have a temporary nature and will hold elections for a permanent setup.
     This view of the Mujahideen is supported by their international supporters who want to see the interim government as broad-based as possible.
     To the Russians and the communist regime in Kabul, a political solution is power sharing between the regime and the resistance. They are for direct negotiations with the resistance and an international conference to guarantee the non-aligned status of Afghanistan.
     The Kabul regime is not ready to give up power and the Mujahideen are not ready to share power with the regime. The role of PDPA in the future is the central issue in the conflict
     The Mujahideen have said they will never deal with the regime. This was the reason for the deadlock in the negotiations between the Mujahideen and the Soviets.
     Although the idea of searching for a political solution to the problem of Afghanistan can not be rejected, if the efforts are based on the assumption that a military stalemate prevails on the battlefields, it could lead to unwanted consequences.
     The Jalalabad episode should not be used as measuring stick for the military situation in Afghanistan. This area has never been a good example for organized armed struggle in the ten years of war.
     To understand the situation one should take into accounts the heterogeneous nature of different fronts. One has to be very careful in drawing general conclusion from studying a specific area because it may not apply to other areas.
     Militarily, the Jalalabad campaign was successful to a large extent The city was besieged, its supply lines were cut, heavy casualties were inflicted on the enemy and more important fighting against the enemy still continues.
     The real disaster came from the way die propaganda side of die campaign was managed. The tall claims of some political leaders created confusion. They gave the impression that the war was easy and victory was close.
     There is no stalemate situation all ova- Afghanistan. As each day passes the
regime's difficulties increase. Different Mujahideen fronts are completing their preparations for large scale attacks. The Fighting season has just started and very soon the level of fighting will increase.*
      Therefore, any change in the policy of the supporters of the Mujahideen based on the assumption that there is a stalemate in the battlefield is premature and based on false assumptions.
      Fortunately the Pakistan and US leaders did the right thing. Their leaders renewed their support for Afghans in their struggle for self-determination. The two sides stressed die need for a political solution to the issue and asked the Kabul regime to step down in favor of a broad-based government
      The Geneva accord and the UN resolutions ask for the right of self-determination of Afghans in addition to the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Fortunately the first objective has been achieved but the fundamental issue of the right of Afghans to determine their future has still remained unsolved.
      It is the moral duty of peace-loving countries especially those who signed the Geneva accords to help Afghans to determine their future. If peaceful means fail to achieve the aim, they should help the Mujahideen to do it militarily.
      For Pakistan and Iran, the solution to the Afghan problem is very important. If peace does not come to Afghanistan, refugees can not return and the region will be exposed to the threat of war.
      Those who favor a change in American policy towards Afghanistan should see the other side of problem as well. What has the Soviet Union been doing since February IS, the day when their troops left Afghanistan?
      That country has left large quantities of military and non-military supplies to the regime and continues to send more; has kept its military advisors in Afghanistan; has bombed the Mujahideen position by planes flown from the bases inside the Soviet Union and has actively supported the regime in international forums. Under these circumstances, talking of cutting supplies to the Mujahideen is leaving the defenseless Afghans to the communist criminals who are well armed and have no mercy on anyone including the women and children.
      Afghans started their war without assurance of foreign aid. For them die struggle to self-determination is a necessity not a luxury. With aid or without it, they will fight and firmly believe in their final victory.

 Glimpses into the historical background of the Part (6)
 The Islamic Movement in Afghanistan
                      Memoirs of Dr. Tawana
     Islamic Movement in exile: After Prof. Rabbani and other brothers migrated to Pakistan, the main stream of the Islamic Movement activities also moved to Pakistan. Hie Movement began constructive work to fortify its
     I remained ihside Afghanistan, however. The activity of those few members of the Movement who had escaped from Daud's torture houses without fleeing outside the country or going into hiding were very limited. Our secret meetings for exchange of views lode place only after long intervals and with few participants.We tried to keep in touch with the brothers who had migrated or gone into hiding inside die country. We also tried to learn about the views and activities of those who had encircled Daud; i.e., the communists.
     During that period, we used to get booklets written by Prof. Rabbani. They strongly condemned the ruling regime and analyzed the future course of events. We also used to get news of deep differences among the brothers who had gone abroad. The only thing we could do was to appeal to them and earnestly talk to them to solve their differences and stay united. Unfortunately, however, the situation deteriorated with the passage of time.
     In 1975, the brothers who had gone into exile organized some aimed actions against Daud's regime in some parts of the country, such as Kunar, Laghman, and Panjshir. The original plan was to assassinate some prominent communists. Why and how the original plan was dropped and armed action was launched is not clear to me. What 1 do know is die fact that Prof. Rabbani was not responsible for the change at all. The issue of the failed armed actions intensified the differences among the brothers and finally led to the separation of the two groups.
     My personal view about the armed actions at that time was the following: If they were the beginning of a long term armed struggle Which would continue until the overthrow of the atheist regime and the establishment of an Islamic Government, they deserved approval and support On die contrary, if they were just a single military maneuver, they were futile and waste of scarce manpower and resources.
     In April 1978, the communist coup took place, and the situation for the Muslim became worse. Most of the
remaining members of the Islamic Movement were forced to leave the country. I also began a trip towards the land of refuge along with three companions. Unfortunately, 1 was arrested at the border post by the puppet regime authoritiesa An old-time communist was included in the group which arrested us. I tried very hard to encourage him to release us. But I failed to convince him. Our arguments lasted till 3:00 aon. finally they decided to take us to some barracks to spend the night and be taken to the city die next morning. We walked to the barracks which were located at some distance. Along the way, I and my three companions realized we had moved quite far ahead of those who had us in their custody. Thus, we began running towards the mountain as fast as we could. By the dawn, we had passed the danger zone and had entered Pakistan.
    During one month that I had stayed in Kabul after April 27 coup, I had heard some good news about reconciliation and re-unity between Prof. Rabbani and Mr. Hikmatyar. I had also heard such reports that a lot of volunteers had joined them to fight against the communist regime, that they bad a lot of weapons, and that 3000 armed Mujahideen consisting of Afghan students at religious schools in Pakistan had entered Badakhshan through Chitral. Those reports had matte me and other members of the Movement think that the fall of Kabul was imminent When 1 came to Peshawar, however, I neither found peace and brotherhood among the brothers nor any sign of preparations against the enemy nor any sign of abundant weapons aid Mujahideen.
    When we first reached Peshawar in mid-May 1978, we looked for Jamaat Islami Pakistan office so that it could lead us to our brothers. We found an office. We were warmly welcomed and asked whom we wanted to see. I gave die names of Prof. Rabbani, Eng. Hikmatyar and Qazi Mohammad Amin. They could find Prof. Rabbani by phone. We talked to him and he came and took us along. Later on, we were housed in Khyber Bazaar, Peshawar. I shared the place with some prominent Ulama and elders who had recently migrated. Mawlawi Said Akbar, Mawlawi Mohammad Yusuf, Mawlawi Abdul Qudoos, and Mawlawi Fayiz— who was one of my companions in the trip from Kabul to Peshawar— were included
among them.
     During the first days in Peshawar, we talked to a number of brothers in an attempt to bring reconciliation and unity among the brothers. Prof. Rabbani was the first person to whom we talked. He accepted our proposal for serving as mediator. Before we could do much, however, he went on a trip to Saudi Arabia. The trip lasted for one month. After his return, the work progressed and contacts were established with both sides.
     I resigned from the membership of the reconciliation delegation at an early stage. The reason was that I was aware of Hikmaiyar's view of me. He considered me as a supporter of Prof. Rabbani. Mawlawi Hamdullah from Kunar joined the delegation at a later
     The delegation offered its proposal for mediation to both sides, and they agreed. Than the names of the members of the delegation were officially submitted. The two parties voiced confidence in them. Then the delegation proposed a scheme for unity which included die formation of a 21 member council. Seven persons would be from Jami'at members, seven from Hezb members, and the other seven would be die members of the reconciliation delegation themselves.
     The proposal was accepted by both sides. The delegation asked both parties to introduce their candidates for the council. It took the list of each party to the other side and sought its approval. Finally the 21 member council was formed. Then the delegation requested each side to nominate someone for the chairmanship of the council who would also serve as the president of the new party comprising Jami’at and Hezb.
     Jami'at nominated Prof. Rabbani. Hezb Islami, whose leader was Hikmatyar, nominated Qazi Mohammad Amin, deputy of the party. The reconciliation delegation nominated Mawlawi Fayiz.
     After the names of the candidates were announced. Prof. Rabbani withdrew in favor of Mawlawi Fayiz. After that the Hezb candidate also withdrew. Thus, Mawlawi Fayiz said that once unity between the two parties was firm, he would relinquish the job. Hezb Islami, however, asked all its members wholeheartedly to support Mr. Fayiz's appointment as president of the new unity and chairman of the council.

          Wise leadership, moderate policy can solve Afghanistan problems
In addition to a broad-based nature.
     Only a wise leadership and a moderate policy can take Afghanistan out of the present uncertain situation.
     The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has created many domestic and international issues far Afghans which need careful handling.
     The war in Afghanistan destroyed the political system of that country. The Soviets failed to replace it with a client regime and the Mujahideen have a long way to go to fill the gap.
     The war also has destabilized Afghan society. A large number of people live in exile and some others are displaced in their own country. The majority support the Mujahideen but there are a considerable number of people who have taken sides with the regime for one reason or another.
     The invasion and consequent fighting has devastated the country and has destroyed its economic system. The major problem will be reconstruction of the country. Funds and manpower are needed to do the job.
     Big expectation, of the people after die liberation will add to die difficulties of the country. Those fighting for liberation want to see the benefit of their struggle in the form of a better economic life.
     To deal with these issues, Afghans need a stable central government, formation of the interim government by the Mujahideen is a step in the right direction but more is needed to be done.
     A stable government will be formed when all sections of the Afghan society support it The present government has to include the Iran-based eight-party coalition and others before it can credibly claim to enjoy the status of a broad-based government
     Representation from all sections of society must be translated at all levels of the government structure. This needs the collective attention of the parties. One should not see repetition of what happened for selecting members of the consultative body. In that council the number of delegates salt by provinces bordering Pakistan provided the majority of the delegates in the Council. This caused dis-satisfaction among some Afghans.
     Since the interim government is at the beginning of its organizational work, it must act carefully or face tremendous difficulties in the future.
 the government must adopt a balanced domestic policy. Injustice towards a group of people or a special geographical area could cause amplications. The people all over Afghanistan expect fair treatment from a government formed by the Mujahideen.
     It is important for the president, prime minister and ministers of the Interim government to familiarize themselves with different sections of the society and differentiate between a political party and the government
     They should contact the field commanders to get to know them and gain their support for the interim government. The commandos' cooperation with the interim government depends on the way the government treats them.
     If the government is able to secure the support of people, inside and outside, the rest of the work becomes easy.
     The interim government also faces complicated international problems. Before the Soviet invasion Afghanistan was a non-aligned country with normal relationship with its neighbors and the rest of the world. The Soviet invasion ended that status and there is a need for a sound foreign policy which suits the country.
     While Afghans will not consider the Soviet Union a friendly country, they have to live with it as their neighbor. Fortunately most of the resistance parties have stated that they are in favor of a normal relationship with Soviet Union if that country stops interference in the affairs of Afghanistan.
     The war has brought Afghans close to the outside world. Five million refugees live in Pakistan and Iran. The tremendous political and humanitarian help these countries have given to the Mqjahideen will always be appreciated by Afghans.
     The moral and material support of the Islamic countries, western democracies and the rest of the world will be remembered by Afghans. Afghans like to enjoy cordial relations with all these countries. The interim government needs to seek the support of these countries in the reconstruction of the country.
     In formulating a suitable foreign policy for Afghanistan, the government should take into account the sensitive geographical location of Afghanistan.
     The countries which we want to
 have good relations with have their own {References. Their specific and diverse national interests makes the wrak of the new government of the Mujahideen difficult
     In the past ten years we have been dealing with this delicate situation quite successfully. For example, the resistance enjoyed good relationships with both Iran and America who. had their differences of opinion on the issue.
     Afghanistan needs stability and peace to deal with its domestic issues. It can not turn into a battle ground for rival powers.
     Every country has its own national interest and our national interest must be preferred in dealing with outside countries.
     It is hoped that the friendly countries realize the need of such an independent policy and continue to support Afghanistan to emerge as a non-aligned, independent and 'Islamic country.
     It is in the best interest of all our neighbors, including die Soviet Union, to see an independent and stable Afghanistan. Let us hope that Mr. Gorbachev, having learned lessons from his country's failure in Afghanistan, will not create further problems for it.
     Those countries who have supported in our struggle for liberation should continue their unconditional support for rebuilding Afghanistan.
     A wise leadership and a moderate policy will steer Afghanistan out of the present imcertaiif situation.
                                                   Afghan lawyers form Union
     The Union of Afghanistan Lawyers was set up in Peshawar for die first time in a decade on May 23, an AMRC correspondent reported.
     Over 100 lawyers and judges of Afghanistan attended the Tuesday meeting. Abdul Jabbar Sabit was elected head of Union. Nimatullah Shahrani was elected deputy and Rizwan Mohammad as the secretary of the Union.
     Sabit, head of the Union, told AMRC correspondent that the union of Lawyers was framed to fill the legal vacuum caused by the Soviet occupation.

100 killed in ethnic unrest
in Soviet Uzbekistan
     A railroad disaster and ethnic unrests has claimed the lives of more than 900 people in the Soviet Union, news agencies reported.
     800 people were killed when two trains on the trans-Siberian line took fire on June 4. The two trains were passing the area when a gas pipeline exploded setting the trains on fire. Among these killed were 40 school children.
     In Uzbekistan ethnic unrest claimed the lives of 100 and more 500 people were injured.
     The ethnic unrest, according to news agencies, broke out near Farghana city in Uzbekistan on June 3.
     Gashes took place between local Uzbeks and minority Meskhetain Turks who were departed from Georgia during world war n by Stalin.
     A large number of houses were set on fire. The authorities imposed a curfew in parts of Uzbekistan.
      Ethnic unrest has become a common problem in different parts of the Soviet empire. Unrest in Georgia, Amrmenia, Azerbaijan, and the Baltic states have created alot of problems for the Soviet government.
      By gaining a little freedom to express themselves different nationalities within the Soviet Union demand more freedom. They want religious freedom and the right to five according to their culture.
      Since die non-Russian population of the USSR is growing rapidly, it would be difficult for the Soviet leadership to preserve the present system of die empire which is basedon the supremacy of the Russians majority at the expense of the rights of non-Russian nationalities.
      Communism has failed to bring people of different ethnic groups close together, something falsely claimed by die Soviet leaders in the past.
Ex-ki
of 'National Front'
      Mohammad Zahir, the ex-king, Who has lived in exile in Rome since 1973, has asked for the formation of a national front to overcome the present difficulties.
      In an interview with VOA he said that Afghans were united against the Soviet Union and this unity made them victorious. He said that after the Soviet withdrawal Afghans, could not maintain their unityfl);
      He proposed formation of a Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) to decide the future form of government in Afghanistan.
      Zahir Shah was deposed by his cousin, Daud in 1973. He did not take an active part in Jehad against the Soviet invaders. Due to difficulties between Mujahideen groups, his name is often proposed as a third-party solution to the Afghan crisis.
      The communist regime in Kabul and the Soviets say that the ex-king can play a role in bringing peace. But the king so far has rejected doing anything with the regime.
      The resistance is divided on the role the ex-King can play. Islamist parties, known in the West as fundamentalists, are opposed to any role played by the king.
      The so-called moderates either
 openly support his return or do not oppose it. But they do not agree on the role he should be given. The Iran-based parties have opposed the return of the king.
     The king himself is waiting and watching. According to available information the king is waiting for a time when all Afghan parties and both superpowers ask him to step in and lead the country. People who know the king doubt that he will hold any responsibility if he is opposed by some Mujahideen groups. He has been a weak leader, not strong enough to take the risks to become the Afghan ruler in a very critical time.
     In the Loya Jirga convened by the communist regime a three-member delegation was formed to hold talks with the ex-King and other opposition groups. It is not clear whether the long will meet the delegation or not -
     The king's view that Afghans have given up their unity after the Soviet withdrawal is strange because there is no evidence of increased disputes among the Mujahideen. The delay in the Mujahideen victory over the regime is the result of a number of factors and cannot be blamed on increased disunity among die resistance fighters.
      The third round of talks between the Mujahideen and the Soviet Union representatives on the issue of prisoners qf war was held at die foreign ministry of Pakistan in Islamabad on June 6. •The talks continued for 45 minutes.
 The Mujahideen side in the talks were represented by a 4-member team while the Soviet delegation woe the officials of the Soviet embassy in Islamabad.
      Soviets say that their 313 servicemen are missing while the Mujahideen put the figures of their missing fighters to several thousands some of whom are believed to be held inside the Soviet Union.
      Before completion of troop withdrawals a large number of well known Mujahideen prisoners were transferred to some unknown destination. The Mujahideen believe dial either they were killed or were taken to the Soviet Union. Professor Rabbani has informed Amnesty International about the incident and has asked the organization to locate these prisoners so that their families may be informed.
      In the past Soviet made deals with the Mujahideen parties and commander to exchange POWs.
      It is said that the Soviets are planning to send a team of the mothers of the missing soldiers to Pakistan to talk to the Mujahideen. This could be an attempt by the Soviets to draw public attention towards the problem and put pressure on the Mujahideen.
                                           Snow destroys fruit threes
     Late snowfall destroyed fruit trees in several districts in Baghlan and Takhar provinces, Mujahideen reaching Peshawar reported.
     Last winter was harsh and long. The last snow, which fell on May 7, destroyed fruit trees in Andarab, Khost and parts of Farkhar.
     "People will not eat apricots, al monds, apples and cherries this year because the late snow broke all the branches of the trees," said a Mujahid from Khost-o-Frmg.
     However, the effect of rain and snow has been positive on the harvest
