 Change of government should not alter Afghan policy
     Holding oi election in a peaceful manner was s great success for the g^verrittietit^iid' tiu? people oi Pakistan. The next step mil be formation an elected government. which will take place soon
     Hue foreign policy oi trie new government on the Afghan issue is at the center oi the attention oi those concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. Afghans expect tne new government to continue isupporting, them in a critical period of their straggle.
     Some of the opposition forces who have wa enough seat? tn the ■ national assembly of Pakistan and may form the new government have been critical ot the government policy on Afghanistan. The past j Jsmi'et in South"Vest renuirJu of the*# leaders have created seer among the Mujahideen oi ;a possible change in Afghan policy. How that these leader have emerged as an important political force, will they fry to change flu?
 Afghan policy of Pakistan? It they do to what extent ?
     The positive role that Pakistan bias played in support oi Afghan Mujahideen has been a key factor in forcing the Soviet Union to start :the 'Withdrawal of its troops.
     Pakistan has done a great job by giving shelter to % million Afghan refugees. Despite the economic., social and other problems , arising irons, the presence of the refugees, the hospitality of the government and the people oi Pakistan provides a golden example of Islamic brotherhood.
     Fakistan also has been leading the diplomatic \var against the invaders in all the international forums. In the UN. in the ; Organisation of Islamic- Conference, in the non-Aiigned Movement jand other forums Pakistan lias played a pivotal role in drafting end passing of the resolutions asking for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the right of Afghans tor self-deterrednation.
     Pakistan has paid a dear price for its policy ox supporting I Afghans. This country had been a target of Soviet -sponsored acts of ; Terrorism in the form# oi air and ground violation* os its territory :and sabotage incidents. Hundreds of innocent Pakistani and Afghan : refugees had been maimed or killed in these inhuman actions.
     Despite the high price, the Pakistan people and Government have stood firm and have faced the challenges bravely.
     The Afghan Policy oi Pakistan has earned nae country a special 1 position among the international community The Islamic world, the tion-aligned Movement and the rest of the tree world has admired the position oi Pakistan on Afghan Utttf,
     Aighan struggle he# entered a critical phase. K*lf of th® Soviet : troop# haw left and the Kajthid**A are expending tf&is eonteci. The 'communist regime ts surviving only because ot the Soviet fixe power,
                                                        ; At ilu$ critical Hme Pakistan’z support tor the Mujahideen is th®
 : more vital than ever.
     National interest determines the foreign policies of true court' tries. It is in the best interest of Pakistan to see Afghanistan im-;merges as a tree., non-aligned and Islamic country with a representative government in control.
                                                                                              Tunrn to pag# (6 )

 ■ cide about the .administrative ! structure of ft# district,
 ! Sarfcani has a lot of land but : little w&tor. Kunar river is flow-
 ing-close to it but due to* lack of an irrigation system the lard is not exploited, 1
     A truck took as to Asadafead, the provincial capital at Kunar.
 ; This little town is situated at the ,
 : junction oi the two rivers. It is a j ! green town with gardes1#, farms, ;

  Taif talks proper step in right direction
     THE Taif talks between the Mujahideen aid the Soviets were his-j toxic. The Sonet Union. which had repeatedly refused to talk to the | Mujahideen and called them bandits, finally came to the negotiating' j table .It was? a victory fox the stand of the Mujahideen who wanted to | speak to the invaders themeeives. If came late but it was good to sea it happen.
I In the first round of talks the Mujahideen's performance was | very satisfactory . They kept their unity, defended their positions I correctly and showed mstc.rs.fy and skill in dealing with the poHis -| cal affairs.
3 The future round# of talks will be more detailed and need better
B
                          preparation and care. The problem of the Resistance is in its eosH-j tiott nature and rotational leadership system. Every three months I the head of the Alliance changes. Vhat will the effect of this he on | the composition of the negotiating team? It is necessary to choose the negotiating team to make at're that continuity is maintained.
     St is also necessary that the council of the Alliance give its mandate to certain issues on the agenda so that the negotiating team should not face problems dozing, the talks and so that no room, should be left lor rumors about rifts among the Mujahideen. The ste-gotiaiiisg team should brief the council of the Alliance as soon as the round of talks lias ended.
     The outcome of such talks mainly depends on free attitude cd the Soviet side. The Soviets, who committed the crime of invading Afghanistan, should correct their mistakes. If the Soviets in the n» -gptiations press for what they have been asking in public, the talks will go nowhere.
     If they insist on a coalition government with the communist xe~ j gime and intend to use their presence in Afghanistan to impose such. I an ides on. the Mujahideen they ere mistaken.
i One other positive aspect of the recent talks was the opportunity j for both sides to hear the views of the other side directly. This may bring a change in the wrong, perception the Russians have of the Mujahideen. Use Mujahideen views about § jjBn-slig&ed Islamic Afghanistan could be interesting for the Soviets.
     It will also he interesting fox the Soviets to notice that these who axe fighting, against them under the banner oi Islam, want not only freedom but social justice and economic progress. It must have been a surprise for the Soviet side to see that though the Mujahideen want peace., it is not because of tiredness from struggle. The Mujahideen are for peace but that type of peace which gives them their freedom.
     Talks with the Soviets have also helped the Resistance leaders in their domestic politics-There were people among, the Afghans who often that said the Mujahideen know how to fight hut a politic*! struggle needs different skills which the Mujahideen leadership
                                                                                          Turn to page C 4 )
                         papers,
                             ces
    THE Soviet-backed regime in Kabul has taken steps to deal with the severe economic problems it is facing.
    One of the the steps was closure of some official publications and merging of some others. This decision w taken on November 22 by the cabinet of Hasan Sharq.
    It "wee also decided that the sise of the regime commercial office in Moscow should be reduced and Commercial attache offices in. Beihi, Bombay, Amritsar, Kuwait, ^mania, Karachi, Czechoslovakia and GBR be closed.
    The regime depends on Soviet loans and credits to run its ad-miaistrstien and to shoulder the burden of the wax.
    lfow that the Soviets have withdrawn half their troops, they may not be ready to finance such unprofitable offices just fox political reasons. If the Soviets stop helping the regime to pay its officers and soldiers it will iesd to collapse of the regime.
    Economic problems were among other f actors which have forced the Soviets to reconsider their policy in Afghanistan. There are serious doubts if the Soviets mil continue to help the regime for a long time because it is too costly fox a country facing food problems, ethnic disturbance and natural disasters.
    More important the shaky nature oi the regime will not err couraged the Soviets to invest in it any longer. [}

     The last meeting, which lasted for one and half hours, was held the same day at 7:30 in the I afternoon.
     At the end the two sides agreed to continue the talks at s place and time suitable for the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen proposed Pakistan as the place for meeting. The time wilt be set after consultation with tine host country. During the meeting the Soviets proposed a ceasefire and the beginning of a dialog between the Mujahideen and regime in Kabul. This was not acceptable to the Mujahideen.
     The Mujahideen emphasised the steed for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and a peaceful transfer of power to the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen del -egation assured the Soviet side of establishing nc-renal ties with all countries , including, the Soviet Union, based on mutual respect and non-interference in the af fairs of each other.
     To prove his points Professor Babbsni quoted Gorbac-hov on several occasions. He had taken with him Gorbachov's book “ Perestroika5' to the conference haU-
     Sebghatuliah Mujaddidi, the chairman of Motional liberation Front, Abdul Qadir Karyeb the head of the political committee of Hexbi-lslami (Hekmstyar), Engineer Ssyyed Asia, the head of solitary committee of Jared'at Island Afghanistan and Mohammad Esliaq, a political of'

[
      Nine years ego, on PecerrJbc-r 27 the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan to impose a puppet regime on Alghane. The Soviet | Union succeeded in destroying.
 Afghanistan and killing, hundreds of thousands of its people, hut it failed to conquer the gpii -it of Afghans.
     The Soviet Union's desire to spread its influence in Afghanistan goes hack to the pre-communist revolution peri-] od, hut its form has changed from time to time. From 1920 to 1979 the Soviets employed military, economic, cultural and ed-UGSiionsi cooperations to spread
I its influence.
     The major step in this direc-. Hon -was creation of the PBPA in ? the 60s, The Soviets helped this i party by different means. In one \ of the phases Baud, the late president, was used to provide protection for the communists. Baud's cmp of 1973 give the communists a golden chance of power -sharing in. government.
     The Coup of i 978 by the PDF A gave the Soviets full control of Afghsrastan. Imposition of the Soviet way of life was carried out by the new hut proud communist regime ruthlessly.
     The people of Afghanistan \ disapproved of the wn-Islamic > intervention of the comartunists | in their lives. Var broke out and S spread all over tlie country. The | regime, which was helped by the j Soviets, started to lose ground. The Soviet leadership could not | accept the fail of the regime and | made the great mistake of send -! ing the Bed Army into a small \ non-aligned neighboring country j. This aggression caught the j whole world by surprise .
 | The Afghan resisted the in-I va&ers effectively. Jehad, the I holy war against the Soviets and | their surrogates, cost the Afghan people a lot. Five million became refugees, half a million were killed, ?5<& of ail the villages ataS towns were destroyed Nine years oi torturing a nation, mu-
tilation, of its culture and degradation of its places of worship and religious books are more painful than the physical hardships inflicted by the invaders.
     The heroic'struggle of the Afghans has finally paid off. The Soviets admitted their mistakes and called it a bleeding woagd.
I As usual their words dtd not j match their deeds. The Soviet ! Union, has failed to take proper I steps to correct the mistake and | end the tragedy.
! This long tragedy will come i to on end when the Soviets withdraw their troops and end interference in the affairs of Afghanistan. The Soviets haw said they are for peace but to achieve that objective they tisw
 refused to take proper steps.
     It would tew been nice for. Afghans and the rest of the world to see the end of the war in 193$. Despite optimism generated by Soviet rhetoric, that happy moment is not yet in sight.
     How that the Soviets have started to talk to the Mujahideen, they should come up with practical proposals to end the war. The reason the Soviets give for not withdrawing their troops are their fabrication or product of the invasion itself. None of these can justify the occupation of a non-aligned, peaceful and Islamic country one moment further. Fj

 Hchieuements and problems of Mujahideen
    Half of the Soviet troops tew left but the -war1 has not come to an end. The Soviets tew started to tail: with the Mujahideen but one cannot foresee a quick retort of peace to war -tom Afghanistan.
    The year 1988 marked the conclusion of the Geneva accords. After years of negotiation, Pakistan and the Kabul regime signed an agreement, .based on whioh the Soviets committed themselves to withdrawing ail of their troops not later than February 15- 1939. The Soviet Union arid the United States signed as the guarantors of the ; Geneva accords.
 ! The Mujahideen were not part of the deal and quite naturally rejected it. Use war continued and even escalated in tte past few months with the Soviet introduction of new weapons, .involvement in direct combat missions and suspension of the withdrswai of their troops. .
    Feeling the pressure of the Xlujshideen in the battleground | and the diplomatic pressure S from outside, the Soviets were j forced to favor signing, of the J Geneva accords. But they expected the communist regime in Kabul to survive after they ted withdrawn.
    Soon after the Geneva accords1 the military situation showed a gradual shift in favor of the Mujahideen. As the Soviet forces left some areas, the Mujahideen brought them under their control. This worried the Soviets who were not prepared to see the fall of the regime.
    This fact explains the Soviet's course of action in the post-Geneva period. On one tend they want to disengage themselves from direct conflict, on the other hand, they are net ready to see the end of the regime at the tend of the

 Mujahideen. 1
    Military situation
    Tte Signing of the Geneva accords which resulted in the withdrawal of some of the Soviet troops has changed the military balance in favor of the Resistance .The Mujahideen have the possibility to move to art offensive phase. By eliwdasUtm of small garrisons in the countryside the war is directed towards major urban centers, big bases and important communication lines.
    In the absence of Soviet forces, tte regime does not tew? enough force® or the necessary morale to wage en offensive war. tThe only choice remaining to it was to resort to a defensive war.
    Iiue to this change, which has taken place because «f a political decision in Geneva and not as a result of the natural develop-men*, of tte war, both the Mujahideen and the communist regime have faced some difficulties.
    The Afghan communist forces have given up the combat and moral support of the Red Army. They do mi tew enough?, trained people to fill the gap created by the withdrawal. Factional differences have created an extra dimension to the regime's difficulties. Insertion of the puppet troops continues. Although large-scale desertion tec not taken place, still del action is a major problem for the carmunist army. The supply lines of the enemy are vulnerable sad in time will turn into one oi its major problems.
    The regime forest have .'enoughsupplies of all sorts but J the low morale of the troops does j not permit item to make use of [their weapons effectively. There is no choice left to them but to
 evacuate some areas, reinforce tteir position® in. the cities and fight a defensive war.
    The Mujahideen's military difficulties are many. First, they are not fully prepared for coordinated military offensive. The main reason for this unprepared-ness is the quick change that tes taken pfoce. formally guerrilla warfare moves from one phase to another in a relatively long period, hut in Afghanistan the change was abrupt.
    The second issue is differences among the Mujahideen. To move to the offensive phase, it is not entKxgh that the fronts belonging. to different parties jest so-exist. They need better cooperation. One must admit that the level of cooperation is not 1 satisfactory.
    The third issue is the un-temogps&HES development of the rear. la. some &reas the Mujahideen have developed a high level of tactic-ad and strategic fcmwiedg? about war and have crested proper organisations. la otter areas this type of change tes not taken place. Sue to this problem coordination of the Mujahideen's activities over relatively large axees is not easy. Lack of experience in large-scale warfare is an additional problem. To overcome these problems, the
 I Mujahideen need to do a let of
 military and political work. Such
 [ a work has been started by the
 | Supervisory Council of the Worth,
 [ headed by Ahmad Shsh Uasood,
 | in the strategically located area
 I of ncrih-east Afghanistan.
 1 The Mujahideen have several | ^
 I strong points compered to the I communist forces:
 | Tte Soviets decision to with-| drsw tteir troops tea given a mb-| rale boost to the Resistance. The j Mujahideen see the result of i their sacrifices.
                                                                    Turn to page (?)

                           From page (6)
 \
     Tl® second positive factor is the control of the strategic areas. Technically spooking,, the      j
 Mujahideen control the territory j they need to launch an offensive, j They control the countryside with its self-sufficient agricultural economy. They control the mountain ranges overlooking the transportation, routes and have uninterrupted connections to the outside world, especially to the friendly countries of Pakistan f and Iran.                        j
     Although « countrywide of- J tensive against the regime has \ not been launched yet, lighting has continued all over the country at a good level. Fighting for the control of Kandahar has continued for some time. Isolation oi the city forced the Soviets to use their air force in support of the regime troops-
     Pressure on jalaiahsd is mounting and the rosda con meeting Kabul to Pakistan are con-i trolled fey the Mujahideen.
 Kunar, Kundus, Kapisa and ^ Fafciiks provinces have been freed. Kun&us was recaptured by the communist forces when, the Soviet forces intervened.
     The enemy transportation lilies have costse under pressure. The Kabul -Kandahar road is blocked. The Kabul-Jalalabad road is disrupted continuously and tlie Salang is not safe for the enemy.
      The enemy relies more and ; more on the air force to inflict losses on the Mujahideen. In the face of shortages of effective missiles this could pose a serious threat to the Mujahideen.
      The Mujahideen'"g supply situation is not satisfactory, .Wow : transport of goods has become easier , but there is not enough equipment and aKunuiiition to equip the Mujahideen for a large-scale offensive. Some weapons,. like anti-aircraft missiles, are in great demand to provide cover for the large scale war that is going to be fought soon.
      Vith the retreat of the com-
 munist forces the supply lines became more secure as>d sow trucks can take goods from border to border of the country without much difficulty.
     In short the signing of the Geneva accords has give a temporary benefit to the Mujahideen. It exploited well, it could bring the war to a quick end„
     Political situation
     The Geneva accords have | created a favorable political atmosphere in Afghanistan for the Mujahideen, Most Afghans, including those working with. the regime, have started to believe that the Mujahideen's victory is inevitable. Internationally, Mb? Geneva accords have put the Mujahideen in a. difficult posi-, tion. Since the regime si gned the accords it gained legitimacy. Pressure on the Soviet Union, de-
 successful at home. Their call for a coalition go wr ament has? been rejected by the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen argue that an illegal ,. regime which is responsible for the destruction of the country and killing of hundreds of thou- ; sands of people csrmot have a role to play in the future poiiti -c-al life of the country.       ;
    The appointment of the Soviet Union Deputy Foreign     j
 minister Mr. Yuri Vorontsov as j
 the ambassador to Kabul was an jt attempt to speed up a political )
 solution. Mr. Vorontsov started jj
 his diplomatic mission in the   I
 wrong wy. His arrival coincided j with the arrival of long range missiies, carpet- tombing and   I
 greater Soviet involvements in   ?
 combat missions against the    ;
 Mujahideen. Evidently the escs- (
 1st ion of the war has been recom* | mended by Vorontsov, feeling unsafe in his office in the Soviet
 spite the presence of their troop© in Afghanistan, decreased. Some people have ©farted to think that the armed struggle against the communist regime and Soviet forces is a civil war rather than ; lighting tor liberation .
     Everything hinges on the time factor. The Mujahideen will decrease the danger to their international position by a quick military victory over the 1 communists,
 I
 s The Soviets and- the regime know that the longer the war con-times the more they will gam ■[ internationally. Sense of the delaying tactics oi the Soviet troop withdrawal are taking place for fids reason.
     The Soviets have been busy building, s favorable image for ! the Kabul regime. “Election" lor the "Parliament'' were held, a f "constitution" was made, and the | idea of power-sharing. with the joppositionforc.es surfaced.

 j sentstives of the Resistance and j j Soviet diplomats on the issue of j ] the prisoners of war have been j j held in Islamabad.            \

  have been asking for such talks lor a long time. j A quick outcome from, the | talks ws not to ho expected. Both sides have agreed to continue the dialogimthe future.
     During the current year the Mujahideen also have been active in the political field hut with mixed results.
     To offer ait alternative government of a transitional nature, the Mujahideen designated a prime Minister and a cabinet in which the Mujahideen, the refugees and Muslims in Afghanistan could participate. The designated gowxnmant needs to do a lot to get support among Afghans.
     The Mujahideen Alliance has
 [started to contact the Shis parties based in Iran in an attempt to coordinate the activities of ] the ^Resistance and to pave- the way for formation of a broad-I based government. For this purpose the current Chairman of the Alliance, Prof. B. Fabfeani intends to visit Iran arid also a | separate delegation of the Alliance has been chosen to consult with refugees and Mujahideen leaders in Iran.
   Belay in contacting the Shi a parties cannot be justified further due to the quick development of the situation in Afghanistan.
  IThe Council of the Alliance also passed laws for an elected council to appoint the Wad of state and to vote for the government. Although all the Muiahideen agree that there is a need for some sort of elections to appoint the Council, due to the tvar in Af ghsnistan end die -placement of a large part of the population, holding elections in j the country could have a lot of j practical problems.
  IThe UN, which avoided formal contacts with the Mujahideen* has changed its policy and started to hold talks with the Mujahideen leadership. In November the Chairman of the | Alliance of the Mujahideen, held j talks with the UN General
 Secretary at the UN headquarters : in New York. It shews that the I world body realises that without j the participation of the         j
 Mujahideen peace will not return | to Afghanistan. UN mediator, Mr. I Biego Cordovas was relieved of j tds duties as a mediator between ! Afghans. His relationship with j the Mujahideen was not as good as it was with the other side. The j TO Secretary -General Feres de Cueilar himself has assumed this difficult lob arid he has been as-; sored of the Mujahideen's cooperation by the Chairman of the Alliance, Frol Burhanuddin Bsbhasi-
     The uncertainty created by the death of president Sis, who supported the Afghan cause, was a source of worry for the Mujahideen.
     The wisdom of the Fafci-siani leadership and people ended that I period. The new elected govern-; ment of Ms. Benazir Bhutto has ; committed itself to the longstanding policy of support for the cause of Afghan freedom.
     The retention of Yaqub Khan as Foreign Minister in the new cabinet shows the desire of ; Prime Minister Benasir Bhutto for continuity in the Afghan policy.
     The efforts of the UN to prepare s program of repatriation.
 i&nd reconstruction in afghani-fftaa did not enter a practical phase during fids year. A major
 (reconstructioneffort cannot take place because the Soviets are still there, the regime in Kabul exists and the war continues.
     The refugees have decided not to return because of the con-j Unastion of the war and presence I ot the communist regime in Kabul, As a result of the escalation of the war, a large number of ; fresh refugees have reached | Pakistan.
 I
 |. Possible developments
 \
 I Future developments revolve j around the decision of the
 Soviets. If they terminate their occupation and withdraw their j troops the end of the war can be I expected. Despite the repeated I assurances of the Soviets to leave j Afghanistan they are connecting I the withdraws! ©f their troops to future political developments. They want to make sure that their puppet regime in Kabul is given a political role An the fa- j tore of Afghanistan.            1
     The resistance think that the [ regime, which is a product of the j invasion, should go. Those who ! are responsible for tins tragic j
 events of Afghanistan do not have | e right to play any role in the fu- j j tare of the country, j In view of the positions of the
 j two sides, reaching a political I compromise seems difficult, j The Afghans have a big task | in front of them. Not only has a \ war to be won .hot a destroyed
 ! country has to be reconstructed. This is a complicated military
 and political problem with economic, social and cultural dimensions.
     A great responsibility rests oil the shoulders of the political parties in the Afghan Resistance. To avoid unhappy developments during and after the war, they should create a strong political system involving the representatives of all sections of Afghan society. The present pace of events is not fast enough to deal with the fast-moving developments, and cooperation among the parties is not at the level which the situation requires.
     In any case tits Soviets c-sa^ot
 stay forever in Afghanistan. The* j regime will collapse because it £ does not have the necessary ele- [ meats of survival. The interior- !
 once of the Soviets will only pro- !; long the war bat cannot stop the [ final victory of the Mujahideen. I The year 1988 was witness to \ some political and military vie- \ tories of the Msialudeen. let us | hope that the year 19$9 will      I

 Gorbachov's recent proposals designed to save Kabul regime
                              By Abdul Haft
    THE Afghan Resistance has rejected the recent proposal of the Sonnet leader for a ceasefire and the introduction of a UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan.
    Mikhail Gorbachov, talking to the UN General. Assembly, proposed observation of a ceasefire from January 1, 1989 and introduction of a UK peacekeeping force in the cities and other strategic areas. He also proposed an arms embargo to all sides of the Afghan conflict and asked for formation of an International conference to study the idea, of the neutrality and disar-mament of Afghanistan.
    The idea of a ceasefire is old. Both the regime and the Soviets had proposed a ceasefire but these were rejected by the Mujahideen, i The Mujahideen argue that 1 as long as the Soviets are in Afghanistan and the Kabul regime exist they will not agree to any ceasefire. The Mujahideen say that the Soviets should pay for every minute of their illegal stay in Afghanistan.'
    An arms embargo came under discussion during the Geneva talks but was rejected by the Soviets. Since- then the Soviets have delivered weapons worth billions of dollars to the Kabul regime. Hew planes were introduced and long-range missiles were brought. All the military installations evacuated by the Soviets were given to the regime.
    Now that the regime is saturated with arms arid ammunition of all sorts, the Soviets want to cut the supply of arms to the 'Mujahideen. Agreeing to
 | this proposal would be- an in-i justice to the cause of
j freedom.
f
 The- idea of an interna-\ honed conference to guaraa-1 tee the neutrality and disarmament of Afghanistan was proposed by JJajib some months ago and raised in | Delhi during Gorbachov's | trip. This is an irrelevant proposal designed to complicate the Afghan issue and to I gain legitimacy for the ! Kabul regime.
 | The- future policy of a | country should be decided by its own people. Now that there is not a legitimate regime m Kabul end the Soviets are still occupying the country discussion about the future of a country contradicts ail the resolutions passed by the UN.
    The idea of disarming Afghanistan is designed to I disarm the Resistance. It j would be logical to call far | the disarming of the aggres-j sors and their surrogates.
 I The Soviets have misused [ their military might and m-| v&ded Afghanistan. They . should be disarmed, not the people of Afghanistan who are defending their honor at the doorstep of their homes. Guns in the hand of thieves, j murderers and invaders is a j source of worry- Guns in the 1 hands of freedom fighters is I a sign of stability. The j Afghan nation cannot be | left defenseless in the jaws | of the red dragon. j In his address at the UN ! Gorbachov failed to address j the basic issue of the with-| drawl of their troops from | Afghanistan. It seems that ' the Soviet are linking troop withdrawal to the future I form of government.
 \
    The Soviet leader assured the General Assembly of his | country's cooperation in re-| construction efforts in | Afghanistan. The Resistance j has repeatedly said that what it wants from the Soviets is the withdrawal of their troops and the end of interference.
    Reconstruction problems and future economic relations can be discussed when the Afghans have gained their freedom and have formed their representative government. Q
 No change in Pakistan's Afghan policy
    PRIME Minister Benazir Bhutto has stressed the importance of continuity in Pakistan's policy towards Afghanistan. In her first press conference after assuming responsibility of the premiership of Pakistan she j also emphasized the need for ■ formation of abroad-based government in Afghanistan to enable the refugees to return in safety and honor.
    In reply to a question she rejected the idea of holding direct talks with the Kabul regime. The Prime Minister of Pakistan welcomed the I talks between the j Mujahideen and the Soviets on the prisoners of war issue and hoped that the scope of the talks would be broadened to cover all issues.
    Prime Minister Benazir has included Yaqub Khan in her cabinet as the Minster of Foreign Affairs to ensure the continuity of the Afghan policy, g
