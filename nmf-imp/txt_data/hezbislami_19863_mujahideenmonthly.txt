 Dear Editor,
 A$ ,a foreigner , J am very interested in, 'the Afghan Jehad and proud that the brave' Mujahideen of Afghanistan have been able to defeat the biggest power of the world in their heroic resistance entering its seven year.
 If possible would you please provide us with some information about Russian prisoners, if you are holding any, and the way they are treated. Thank you.
 Mohammad Kabir Malaysia
 Dear M. Kabir,
 This issue is carrying a letter from a Russian POW and, 'Inshaa-Allah', in the future we will be publishing interviews with prisoners and Russian documents.

  Dear Editor
 I have been reading The Mujahideen Monthly so far. There was a need for such publication and I am happy that you have taken this step.
 I would like to draw your attention to this point, that if possible give us information about the policy of the future Islamic government that the Mujahideen will establish in a free, independent and Islamic Afghanistan. Thank you.
 Mahmood Islamabad
 Dear Mahmood,
 The future Islamic government of Afghanistan will be totally based on The Quran and Sunnah, which protect the rights of individuals and groups in any society.

                         Dear Readers :
 Dear Editor,
 I appreciate your efforts fn publishing The Mujahideen Monthly. I would like to point out that even though the magazine covers a variety of topics it lacks detailed information regarding the administration, security, education and agricultural plans of the Mujahideen in the liberated areas throughout Afghanistan. Providing such information will give us insight into the practical aspects of the Mujahideen beyond direct combat with the enemy. Thank you.
 A. Qayum Lahore
 Dear A. Qayum,
 Thank you for your suggestions, the Editorial board is considering publishing details of the Mujahideen's social, agricultural and economic policies for the liberated areas in future issues.
 Aslam-u-Alikum The Editor.
                         The Editorial Board of The Mujahideen Monthly appreciates your comments, views, suggestions and criticism about the magazine and considers them as significant contribution to the further improvement of our work both in term of appearance and that of the text.

                                                                             Jinlandizaiion .
  A recent report in the Christian Science Monitor about the "Finiand of Afghanistan" and what is believed to be a Soviet overture towards a final solution of the crisis seems as ridiculous and oppobrious as the invasion of Afghanistan itself.
     If the Soviets and the Americans really make such an agreement it will only prove the hypocrisy of the Superpowers and the steadily increasing rejection of the Soviets' intervention in Afghanistan by the Russian rank and file and the majority of its military officers.
     The truth about this unjust and brutal war being waged by the Red Army against the Mujahideen, its atrocities and heavy los'ses, is no longer a secret to the people of the USSR — nor is it acceptable to them..
     In invading Afghanistan the Soviet government underestimated the resolve of the Afghan people to fight and made the mistake of comparing our Muslim nation with people of Czechoslovakia and Hungary — two nations who submitted to Moscow in the face of oppression.
     History has been a witness to the fact that the Afghan people have never been subjugated by any foreign power. The British imperialists learned many good lessons from their bitter experiences in Afghanistan and these should have been reflected upon by the Russians before they invaded.
     The idea of the Finiandization of Afghanistan or turning Pakistan into a so-called Islamic Austria is absurd. The Afghan Muja-hid nation will never allow any foreign power to dictate their system of governments. As tar as the Afghans are concerned will never bow down to any foreign trusteeship of their affairs.
     Our Mujahid nation has not offered so much sacrifice just for the sake of being
 of Afghanistan ,}
  neutral and impotent bat instead! is fighting to establish an Islamic state which truly non-aligned.
      Trying to turn Afghanistan into another Finland is tantamount to wasting the blood of one million martyrs and as such, regardless of the cost, we will not allow the Superpowers to compromise on the very destiny of our heroic nation.
      The continuing massacres of our people and destruction of our food supplies and livestock by the Russians instead of lowering our morale enhances it and stiffens our determination to fight on.
      It is the Russian army that is demoralised and considers the war purposeless and many Russian troops recognise the invasion for what it is — a lust for expansion on the part of the Kremlin's rulers.
      From the very outset the resistance has had only meagre resources at it disposal but despite this the Kremlin gerontocracy found it necessary to despatch 85,000 troops to bolster its puppets who had utterly failed to contain the Mujahideen.
      Following the invasion the world did not expect the Mujahideen to be able to continue their struggle for even a few months but our conviction in Allah (All Glory be to Him) and
  our fortitude in the face of hardships enabled us to astonish friends and foes alike.
      V\/e believe the more conspiracies hatched against the Mujahideen the more cohesion and co-ordination there will be among us.
      Once again we reiterate the well-known position of the Mujahideen — we wiJI fight to the last Afghan until we achieve our ideal; an Islamic, free, independent Afghanistan, which is truly non-aligned.

GENEVA-THE RHETORIC GOES ON...AND ON
                          BY SUR GUL SPEEN
Geneva is one of the most beautiful cities of Switzerland. The country might be famous for its scenic valleys and mountains and dean cities but what has made Geneva famous is the holding of international meetings, mostly about peace, security and liberty, often under the auspices of the United Nations.
     Even if one does not emphasize the name 'Geneva', in the eyes of the common man Geneva conveys the meanings of peace and liberty. Whenever people come across or hear the name they often think of a meeting about human rights.
     However since the Afghanistan invasion and the use of Geneva as a venue for talks on the crisis the conotations of the name have changed — for many people the images of peace and liberty that the name usually suggests have been tarnished.
     This is because of the Kremlin's continual defiance of the UN's rules and regulations and its willingness to use the Geneva talks as a ploy to further its own ends.
     So far six rounds of talks have been held under the control of the UN's special envoy, Mr Diego Cordovez. The seventh round is due to start soon with a trip by Mr. Cordovez to Teheran, Kabul and Islamabad.
     Unfortunately the Geneva talks have had a negative impact on the Afghanistan issue. Free-minded people would agree with us that the Geneva talks have not yet touched the real parties to the Afghanistan crisis, the Russians, who invaded the country, and the Afghan Mujahideen, who are fighting for Allah's sake to establish an independent Islamic State.
     Usually when an international crisis is negotiated in Geneva the real parties to the dispute attend, but in the case of Afghanistan neither of the real parties is present — Russia is not represented and neither are the Mujahideen.
     In reality the Russians have succeeded in using the UN and the Geneva talks to camouflage their real intentions, to crush the resistance by any means they can, regardless of the cost to innocent people.
     The Kremlin speaks of a political settlement through Geneva when it has no desire for such a settlement and uses the mass media to promote its insidious campaign.
     By promoting the talks Moscow has been able to alienate world opinion from the Mujahideen, weaken sympathy for the Jihad, and create false hope throughout the world of a political settlement.
     It is strange that during the Geneva talks neither the UN nor the world's free press criticizes the Russians' heavy offensives in Afghanistan, offensives that are always intensified while the talks are being held.
     The indirect talks in Geneva between Pakistan and Afghanistan have given an air of legitimacy to the Soviet puppet regime in Kabul and are actually prolonging the
 presence of enemy forces in the country.
     This is because the Kremlin has been holding fast to its demands that the withdrawal of its forces is dependent on the talks and on guarantees that its interests will be protected not only in Afghanistan but also in the region.
     The most negative impact of the Geneva talks is that those countries which are supposed to be backing the Mujahideen, supporting them politically, are not taking effective and decisive action to pressurise the* Russians into withdrawing.
     Since 1982 the Afghans have been listening to the rhetoric at the Geneva talks but perceive them as being talks between irrelevant parties which' are only furthering the Soviet's military plans.
     Geneva-11 was contemporaneous with the Spring offensive by the Russians in the Panjshir valley in which 30,000 enemy troops took part. The offensive ended in widespread destruction throughout the area and the genocide of innocent civilians in the valley itself and districts outside the valley such as Andrab, Kohistan, Gulbahar, Jabul-seraj, Tagab and Nijrab in Parwan province.
     When Geneva-Ill was held the Russians launched an offensive in

 September on Paktika and Ghazni provinces which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of innocent people and made thousands of others homeless.
     Geneva-lV and V saw mass killings in Qandahar, Urozgan and Laghman provinces. The talks were covered hour by hour by the world media but the genocide was reported one month later by the Pakistan press and almost a year later by the world press after the UN report of 1985.
     Geneva-VI was held against the background of another September offensive, this time concentrated in Paktia, Kunar, Logar, Ghazni and Wardak provinces. On August 28, while the delegates were sitting comfortably in Geneva negotiating the issue, four divisions of Russian-Afghan troops, well
 equipped with sophisticated arms, were rampaging through Paktia province, killing people and animals burning farms and forests, and destroying villages.
      Now once again the talks are about to begin. The seventh round of negotiations will open with trips by Mr. Cordovezto Teheran, Kabul and Islamabad.
       The Russians have already started intensifying their brutality with offensives in Nengrahar and Paktia provinces.
        So far the Kremlin has found it easy to continue the genocide in Afghanistan while the talks are being held; they have no ameliorating effect on conditions in our country.
          We are witness that the Kremlin has not shown any sign of leaving Afghistan despite calls for
he withdrawal of Russian troops Dy 122 countries in the latest UN General Assembly; the Non-Aligned Movement fNAMV, the Organisation of Islamic Conferene fOICV, and many individual countries.
       Recently representatives of the Communist parties in Japan, Italy and Sweden, who attended the 27 th Soviet Communist Party Congress, asked the Kremlin to recall its troops.
         It would help the Afghans, and those who share their suffering, if the UN instead of wasting its time by imposing the illegal Russian puppet regime on the Afghans, would launch an international campaign requesting its member countries to politically support the Afghan Mujahideen.
             In this way the UN would be among those to the fore in championing the rights of the oppressed.

  Brezhnev's Boast of Victory Falls
Russia's invasion of Afghanistan has now entered its seventh year — seven years of fighting which has demonstrated the truth, that despite the word/y might and power of the Kremlin Islam triumphs.
     After the Russian forces crossed the Oxus River, the natural boundary between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, in December 1979 Brezhnev during a visit to New Delhi declared that the "limited contingents" of the Red Army had been sent into Afghanistan at the "invitation" of the Afghan Government.
     So far the Russians have offered sundry pretexts for their illegitimate aggression against their tiny, southern neighbour. Once they said Hafizullah Amin called them, then they said they entered Afghanistan in accordance with a treaty they had signed with Taraki in 1978 and lately they have been saying that the PDPA invited them.
     There is no doubt that their claims are false and there is also no doubt about the reasons why Moscow invaded Afghanistan — to crush the Muslim resistance and Sovietize the state.
     Brezhnev once boasted that the Red Army would end the resistance within three months of the invasion out despite the fact that the Russians have increased the original force from 85,000 men to 230,000; despite the fact that they are using the most advanced weaponry including banned arms such as poisonous gas, napalm, dumdum bullets, cluster bombs, booby traps end barrel bombs, they have not been able to achieve any of their goals in Afghanistan.
     After 75 months they are in the same quandary they were in at the beginning of the invasion.
     The Russians made the mistake of thinking Afghanistan would be like Czechoslovakia or Hungary and underestimated the strength, faith and patriotism of our people.
     As the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, said it is easy to invade Afghanistan but it is im-
                                                                      by M. N. Saleem
 possible to keep it and the Soviets should have drawn a lesson from the British experience.
     Her statement was opportune advice which the Kremlin should have heeded.
     Likewise the chairman of Hez i-lslami Gulbudin Hikmatyar has said that the Russians can melt the mountains of Afghanistan but will not be able to conquer the
8
The Mujahideen Monthly
 mind and heart of a single faithful Afghan patriot.
     Such advice should have served as a pertinent warning to the Russians to review their suicidal strategy in Afghanistan. The country has already turned out to be a graveyard for Russian soldiers and a junkyard for their military hardware.
     The Afghans have been the bearers of the torch of freedom in the region in the course of their 3000 year history and have never bowed down before tyrannical powers— Alhamdulillah the Russians are no exception.
      In 1919 the Afghans threw off the yoke of the British Raj to become an independent state — the first nation in South Asia to cast off the British imperialists.
      The Russians' ambitions apropos of establishing a world communist state in the long-term and gaining access to the warm water ports of the Indian Ocean are no longer secret and consequently all free nations should be on guard. It is obvious that the Russians' invasion of Afghanistan and the construction of bases close to the Indian Ocean are part of Moscow's long-term plans.
     When we say effective support we never mean arms and soldiers. We attach more importance to moral support which could easily force the Russians to review their military presence in Afghanistan.
     If the Muslim countries from whom we have high expectations would cut their political and commercial relations with Moscow until they withdraw from Afghanistan that would be the most effective way out of the present stalemate in the face of Russian intransigence.
     This is because when the Russians were considereing invading Afghanistan they were afraid of a sharp reaction from Muslim nations. They thought the Muslim countries would pungently respond by severing all their relations with the Soviets. They considered the American response of wheat embargoes and the Olynr^pic boycott as trivial and transient.
      It is rueful to see that the Muslim countries not only failed to break relations with the Kremlin and Kabul but some of them have been renewing their relations with the Soviets.
      Ironically those countries which are accosting the Soviets for arms have huge oil revenues by virtue of which they can purchase far better arms in the free market.
     The rapproachement of these Muslim countries with the USSR bears out that these countries are heading for the same destiny as that of the hapless Afghans.
     Another area in which the Islamic countries do not live up to our expectations is their apathy to the slaughter of their Muslim brothers and sisters in Afghanistan.
      . ■ -f* '
      They do not even bother to visit Afghanistan and see for themselves the Soviets' crimes and then convey the truth to the unwary people of the world.
      We have rarely seen journalists from the Muslim countries who have taken the trouble to come to Afghanistan and debunk the Russians' claims of peace and progress.
     We are of the opinion that the more we expose the Russians' atrocities the more presssure there will be on Moscow's dictators to withdraw their plundering troops.
     We think it is a contradiction for those Muslim countries to say on the one hand that they are sympathetic to the downtrodden Afghan nation yet on the other hand maintain defacto relations with the Karmal regime, not to speak of full diplomatic relations with the Moscow.
      We appeal to the conscience of the Muslim countries in particular and of the Free World at large not to allow the Russian occupying forces in Afghanistan succeed.
      If they do it will mean the realisation of the Kremlin's global designs, the establishment of a world communist state in which no nation will ever be able to challenge the Russians' wanton aggression and expansionism.
      Therefore it is incumbent upon all Muslims of the world to consider the Afghan Jihad as their own and render assistance in the rescue of Afghanistan from the mouth of the world communist ghoul.

A Letter Of A Russian POW
        In early1985 a Russian soldier was taken prisoner by during
        fighting in Baghlan Province. The soldier, a 19 year old artillery sergent, is from Volga in the Soviet Union. He came to Afghanistan in 1983 and has seen heavy fighting in various provinces. After being taken prisoner e expressed sympathy for the Mujahideen and recently wrote the following letter to The Mujahideen Monthly. For obvious reasons he wishes to remain anonymous.     -----------------------------

Q
 What / saw in Afghanistan, cannot be compared with any inferno, where there were populous areas, and where there were houses and buildings there are now only ruins. Where people were living, can not see anyone, and a complete silence reigns. This calmness and silence is only disrupted by the chirping of birds and the droning of Russian helicopters. This is the only consequence of the Russians' internationalist assistance.
      Yes, the Soviet assistance has induced thousands of people to lose their lives. The Russians' help caused the people not only to lose their property, belongings, but to lose their freedom and country as well. The people have been forced to migrate to other countries. Yet the Soviet Union asks these countries not to give refuge to them in their countries.
      This reign of terror knows no bound*, from severe bombardments to the brutal offensive of Russian forces and genocide of the innocent people of Afghanistan.
      The Russian soldiers or if we calf them wild terrorists are attacking the houses of innocent and unarmed people. Not only do they

  kill men, but they are massacring women, children and old people as well.
       Although such savage terror is prohibited for the army and it is unbearable, such brutal behavior of the Russian soldiers is rewarded by Russian officers of the bloodsucking Red Army. Thus the Russian officers want to force their soldiers to do and launch such savage operations, and thus a lot of Russian soldiers have been losing their lives as the people fight back.
       Those houses and villages which show even little resistance have come under the heavy and barbaric fire, shelling and bombing, of Russian tanks and helicopters. Farms and crops are being set on fire and cattle killed. This way they are trying to bring about famine and under such a situation people either have to die of hunger or take refuge in the neighbouring countries.
     The civilians love and respect the Mujahideen a lot. What the people desire is to voluntarily face the Russian armed forces with all the equipment they have at hand. This is their greatest bravery and that is all.
     These people are fighting against these bloodthirsty Russian forces with their lives and wealth, not only the young and the strong men have taken up arms, but their women and children have also taken up arms against the enemy.
     Right now when I am busy with my writing a young boy, Wali Gul, 14, is sitting near me and he is carrying a rifle which is difficult for him to carry. He with his other brothers is following this long way, which is difficult even for quite strong people. He like
other young fellows is ready all the time to fight and defend his country against those bloodthirsty Russian soldiers who deprived them of their childhood blessings.
                                                                                                                        Even if the Russians want to
 QfiZctsru 'irtu-c
 modernise and uplift the life of the people, the social imperialism of Russia will only bring them the gifts of debauchery, drugs and alcoholism, which is the logical result of Marxism-Leninism.

 want to terrify the people of Afghanistan by killing and looting, but the Russians should know that Afghanistan has never been con-qurered by anybody and no nation has controlled this country. The people of Afghanistan have proudly avowed that they love to accept death, but will not accept Soviet slavery.
      Let the Russian bloodthirsty forces wait for their victory in Afghanistan. Definite defeat is awaiting them. ''Afghanistan is the land of Muslims and Islam is the faith of this nation." One of the Mujahideen during discussion told me that yes, it is true that the Aggressive Russian forces have been defeated disgracefully. Even in face to face fighting the Russian forces are using helicopters and modern bombers, but victory is always on the side of the Mujahideen.
      The government forces of Afghanistan are decreasing and even sections, companies and brigades have joined the Mujahideen. These soldiers do not want to fight against their own people. They do not want to kill their brothers and sisters. These soldiers are not allowed to perform their religious activities in the barracks. They have been deprived of their faith, for which they are sacrificing the whole of their life.
      Communists under the leadership of Soviet puppet, Babrak Karmal, have taken refuge in the big cities and there they are living under the shadow of Russian soJdiers. Even they are afraid in the streets and roads and without bodyguards they cannot go out. This is because they know that the Mujahideen have influence in the cities.

  HINDU LUST FOR
                              by Q.M.Saeed
  MUSLIMS BLEEDING
The bigoted Hindus, with the covert approval of the Indian Government, have once again resorted to spilling the blood of innocent Muslims in India.
    This time the slaughter resulted from the Muslim's sharp reaction to the biased ruling of a Hindu court that a longtime mosque could be converted into a Hindu temple. The riots resulted in the martyrdom of tens of Muslims and spread even to New Delhi.
     Since the introduction of Islam into the Subcontinent the prejudiced Hindu majority have been charting out systematic programs for the massacre of Muslims and looting their homes and villages.
     Each time anti-Muslim violence has erupted Muslim babies,children, women and the aged have been martyred in large numbers.
     The prejudice reached its climax when the Muslims campaigned for the establishment of an independent Islamic state. Their demands united the Muslims of India and their sacrifices ultimately materialised with the formation of Pakistan.
     At the time of the formation of Pakistan Mahatma Gandhi because of his Hindu prejudice aroused the anti-Muslim feel ings of the Hindus resulting in the mass exodus of Muslims from India to the newly formed Islamic Republic — the dreamland of all the Muslims of the Subcontinent.
      The Hindus attacked the caravans of the Muslims looting them and martyring many people, especially women and children.
      Those who reached Pakistan then faced the mammoth task of
  establishing the new state, a fledgling nation which lacked many resources.
      The immigrants rolled up their sleeves to lay the foundations of ^their new homeland while those were left behind, in the Hindu inferno found themselves in perpetual conflict with the enemy, often fighting for their very survival.
      The Hindu violence against the Muslims has always had the blessings of the Government of India and has resulted in the martyrdom of thousands of innocent Muslims.
      The Hindu hypocrisy reached new heights when Mrs Indira Gandhi pursuing Machiavellian policies, assumed office. She promised that the Government would protect the Muslims and restore their civil rights.
       In reality Indira Gandhi's Government fuelled the anti-Muslim feeling among the Hindus. During her tenure as Prime Minister thousands of Muslims were killed and many Muslim women were systematically sterilised under the guise of family planning and population control programs.
       Many Muslim men were also
 forcibly castrated in hospitals throughout India in order to curtail the Muslim population.
     Instead of restoring civil rights to the Muslims her Government continued to supress the Muslims,
 V
 continually trying to deprive them of any power or rights they had.
     However Indira Gandhi's thirst for power was not satisfied and in addition to trying to crush the Muslim population of India she also started meddling in the affairs of East Pakistan.
     Fearful that Pakistan would flourish and become an Islamic force to be reckoned with Gandhi, in collaboration with world imperia lists and social imperialists in particular, worked hard to split East Pakistan from West Pakistan.
     India's forces that invaded East Pakistan stained their hands with the blood of thousands of Bengali mothers and children.
     Although the split between East and West Pakistan was a catastrophe for the whole Muslim Ummah which caused the pleasure of Islam's enemies, yet it led to the creation, of a new Islamic country notr to come under India's sphere.

     When Bangladesh emerged as an independent state Gandhi told a press conference that she was opposed to the idea of two communities at the beginning and was still opposed to it.
     Thanks to Allah (All Glory be to Him) the Muslims in Bangladesh reacted strongly, and told Gandhi that the Muslims were a single nation and would never yield to the yoke of serfdom.
     No sooner had the wounds of the East Bengalis begun to heal than anti-Muslim agitation began in Assam. Once again the Muslims became victims of Hindu atrocities and in the course of anti-Muslim riots in Assam Muslim houses and villages were pillaged, children butchered and women violated. The carnage was vehemently condemned by Muslims throughout the world.
     When Gandhi visited the Assam slaughter house she had to trample on the bodies of Muslim martyrs.
covering her nose to stifle the smell of the decomposing bodies.
     But the Hindus thirst for blood-letting was not quenched and they started to throw the carcases of beheaded pigs before Muslims while they were offering Eid prayers. Often Muslims were attacked while praying, not just in Assam, but also in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh State.
     When Indira Gandhi was assassinated and her son Rajiv came to power the course of anti-Muslim discrimination took a new turn.
     This time the Hindu judicial courts furthered the anti-Muslim agitation by refusing to support Muslim claims for the return of property that had been illegally confiscated. The best example of this is the Babri mosque which was built by Zahiruddin Baber in 1528 after the conquest of Bihar state.
     The mosque served as a place of worship for the Muslims until
 1855 when the Hindus claimed it. The British colonialists, who were always at loggerheads with the Muslims and were constantly trying to weaken them, supported the Hindus. As a result fighting broke out between the two communities and 75 Muslims were martyred. Eventually the Hindus usurped the mosque and turned it into a Hindu temple.
     A Mujahid, Amir Ali, and several other Mujahideen tried to recapture the mosque but the attempt was foiled by joint Hindu-British action.
     In 1885 the matter was broached in the English courts but remained unresolved. After the partition of Pakistan from India in 1947 the matter was again taken up in Hindu courts and was decided in favour of the Hindus.
     As a consequence of Muslim agitation against the court's ruling the Government was forced ‘ to overturn the decision. The judge-

AHDMH RELIEF COMMITTEE
    The Association for the Heirs and Descendants of the Martyrs and the Handicapped (AHDMH) is the first of its kind among the different relief, committees working hard with their limited resources for the Afghans.
    Especially, it is for those Afghans who have lost their dearest relatives such as: parents, sons, daughters, wives, husbands, brothers, and sisters or parts of their bodies during Russian bombardments and shelling of their towns and villages. Also many others who have lost all these in fighting against the Russian Red Army for the independence of their homeland, Afghanistan deserve to be helped by such associations.
    The AHDMH was founded by a group of sincere Afghans soon after the Chardara massacre of early 1985 in Kunduz province, where 570 innocent civilians were slaughtered by the Russian soldiers. Not only in this incident, but as a whole in the past six years more than one million martyrs and close to this number of maimed, multilated and handicapped are the outcome of the Russians aggression in Afghanistan or as the Kremlin calls it 'Moscow's legal assistance for the Afghans'.
    The Russians 'love and friendship' for the Afghans has left hundreds of thousands of orphans and widows, who have to be taken care of. The poor and mentally depressed familiies both in Pakistan and Afghanistan are not able to

 ment which was hanrTpd down by Mi. Nager was quashed and he resigned.
     The temptation has always been there to turn the mosque over to the Hindus and on December 23, 1979 a group of Hindus attacked the mosque smashing doors and windows and installing idols.
     The Muslims reacted vehemently and after six days of violence and looting the Government closed the mosque again, depriving the Muslims of their due rights.
     On February 1, 1986 a Faiza-bad court judge, Mr. K. M. Pundi, a Hindu, ruled that the mosque be re-opened and given to the Hindus again.
     The students of Aligarh University went on strike and the Government once more ordered its closure. The Muslims of Uttar Pradesh declared a black day in protest at the court's decision and in Delhi Imam Bukhari of the Shahi mosque declared a day of mourning and grief to be marked by protests and demonstrations.
     Muslims all over Kaupur and Allahabad staged demonstrations
 against the court's ruling. So far at least 13 people have been killed and hundreds of others wounded in the protests which are continuing.
     To satisfy the Hindus the Government has ordered the closure of 300 mosques.
     In another development the Indian courts, in contempt of Islamic law, have now issued verdicts on the well-known Shah-banu case, a divorce hearing which has hurt not only the feelings of the Indian Muslims but also Mus-
lims throughout the world.
     The truth is of course that discrimination against Muslims is not restricted to India and the Hindus — all over the world Allah's enemies are discriminating against us, either through violence or more subtle forms of persecution.
     In Afghanistan the Russians are committing genocide, butchering Muslims in their thirst for power. In Palestine and Lebanon the Zionists and American imperialists are decimating our people. Likewise systematic measures are being taken in Syria, the Philippines, Indonesia and Libya to suffocate the Ummah.
     A recent speech by the Imam of Shahi mosque in Delhi was well timed. He said that the Muslims of the world were asleep and were not helping the downtrodden Muslims of India against the Hindu onslaught.
     If the 100,000,000 Muslims of the world united then neither the social imperialists, the western imperialists nor their puppets and their proxies would have the guts to tyrannize the Muslim masses.
 against the Hindu Governments barbarism; to help the Palestinians and Lebanese against the Zionists and their godfathers; and if these Islamic nations forced their Governments to cut relations with all imperialist and Zionist governments, then this challenge would be effectively met within a few months.
      We appeal to the Muslims of the world, particularly those in India, to unite and make ready to fight the enemies of Islam and humanity, to keep their Islamic identity and refrain from serving other "isms”. They should wholeheartedly devote themselves to the cause of Islam and sink all their trivial differences.
    We consider the defence of the Indian Muslims incumbent on us and appeal to the Governments of the Islamic countries to exert pressure on the Hindu government to desist from descrating the mosque in Bihar and to respect Islamic laws and traditions.

      Pakistani Parliamentarians Meet Afghan Leaders
 The leaders of the Afghan Mujahideen, Eng. Gulbudin Hekmatyar, the Amir of Hez-i-lslami Afghanistan, and Prof, tiurhanuddin Rabani, the Amir of the Jamiat-i-lslami Afghanistan, have met MNAs and Senators from the Pakistan Government, including Haji Saifullah, Mr. Zafarullah Jamali, Mr. Hamza, Mr. Qazi Abdul Latif, Senator Qazi Hussain Ahmad, Prof. Khursheed Ahmad, Nawabzada Jahangir Shah, Mr. Javed Hashimi and Sayed Assad Gillani.
      They expounded on the overall situation of the Afghan Mujahideen and Afghan refugees and answered the legislators questions.
' Following are excerpts from this
  cordial meeting:
      TheMujahideen leaders thanked the MNAs and Senators for their sympathy with the Mujahideen and the Afghan refugees and said they were equally concerned with the security and territorial integrity of Pakistan. They expressed their ideb-tedness and thanks to the people and Government of Pakistan for their acceptance of more than three million refugees on their soil in the most difficult time of their lives.
      They said that the Mujahideen were not only fighting for the liberation of their country and the establishment of an Islamic state, but also for the emanicipation of the Islamic Ummah at large from'the yoke of world imperialism. Therefore, it was incumbent upon all Muslims to render their Islamic reponsibilities towards the Jihad in Afghanistan.
      They believed that the Russian invasion of Afghanistan was a well-calculated strategy designed to get access to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. "Some people con-
 tend that the Russians' violations of Pakistani airspace is for the hot-pursuit of the Mujahideen and the refugees", they said. They posed the question:       Whom   did  the
 Russians pursue when they sent 85,000 troops in Dec. 1979 into Afghanistan?
 ON BOMB EXPLOSIONS IN PAKISTAN
     They said that the Russians by a series of explosions were trying desparately to create an at-mospere of hatered and animosity between the refugees and their Pakistani brothers. They denounced such Russian intrigues and said as far as the Mujahideen were concerned they would not allow this plot to pay off.They further pointed out that the Russians were hiring and training Pakistani nationals and then sending them back to Pakistan for subversion and sabotage.
     They - said that the refugees were the guests of the Pakistani nation and that they were not guest$ of a particular party or indviduals. They contended that as Pakistan was the only sanctuary for the uprooted Afghans, therefore, they were logically interested
 in its security. They declared that they had never wished to be involved t in the internal politics of Pakistan and would continue to refrain from any involvement in the future.
     They condemned the American veto of the UN security council resolution with regards to the sacrilege of the Al-Aqsa Mosque by th^ Zionists and said it had appalled all Muslims in the world.
 ON A GOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE
    They said although this matter had come under consideration in the supreme council of the Mujahideen, no final decision had been made. However, there were some members of the council who
 advocated the formation of such a government inside Afghanistan provided the Mujahideen could get an air defene system to defend the liberated areas. They said the alliance was a substitute for a government in exile.
