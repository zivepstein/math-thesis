1- EJQ£A
      The two wings of the official Peoples' Democratic Party of Afghanistan - the Khalq and Par-cham - are in fact two separate groups. Each of them is further divided into smaller factions. General Secretary Dr. Najib does not enjoy a majority in the Parcham faction, let alone in the whole party. His main asset is the support he receives from the Russians. In the face of opposition by the followers of Babrak Karmal, Dr. Najib is trying to build a basis of support in the army, as well as among non-party Afghans whom he is trying to win over to his side by appointing them to government positions. In-fighting is frequent. Communist ideology has failed to unite them, though on the surface it provides them with a common shield. If the Russian troops pull out, the PDPA is very likely to disintegrate. It is hated by every one and loved by no one.
2- IHE...RQL.ICY OF . .NATIONAL-RECONCILIATION
     As a person Najib plays his role well in promoting the policy of reconciliation. His drawbacks are, however, many. Foremost among them are the facts that he was the chief of the notorious KHAD, and that he is a puppet of the Russians. Still, he has made some advances among various segments of the urban population for having eased the rigid rule of the days of Karmal, but because of the atrocities committed by the them government, in which Najib headed the notorious KHAD, the chances of its reconciliation with the Afghan people, to say nothing of the armed Mujahideen, seems nil. Perhaps the policy has contributed to the softening of the intensity of the opposition.

 3- ONE-PARTY TO MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT
      Strenuous efforts are being made to replace the original one-party system of government by a coalition of political parties. Members of the pro-Soviet leftist groups, -SAZA- and SAWZA- as well as some former senior bureaucrats and former ministers have been given cabinet positions, without ousting the present cabinet members. The cabinet, as a consequence has swelled and the government has become inefficient to an extraordinary degree. In fact the lower sections of the government, for many reasons, already disintegrated. The groups and persons referred to above carry no popular support and no major groups has joined the government. So the change as a whole has failed to have any effect on the actual political situation in the country.
 *»• MULII -NAT.IONALIIY-EQLI.CY
      The Russians and the Kabul regime ever since the tragic invasion have made efforts to create dis-sention among the many ethnic groups composing the Afghan nation. Their policy is to attract minority groups, particularly their educated elements, £nd to make them conscious of their status by indicating to them openly and on occasion tactlessly that in the past they had been unjustly dominated and exploited by the Pashtuns. Towards this end concessions of all kinds are being extended to the minority ethnic groups, especially to the Hazara and Uzbek groups. In this field the model of the Soviet Central Asian republics is followed in which the leading role given to the Soviet Uzbek and Tajik experts and advisers in Afghanistan, The overall purpose is to suppress and downgrade the role of the Pashtuns who, as a majority ethnic group, constitute the backbone of the opposition to Russian* domination. The followers of former President Hafi-zullah Amin are still called fascists for this rea-

son. Resentment against this policy of "divide and rule" is alive and widespread* With the advent to power of Dr. Najib, himself a Pashtun, some remedial measures have already been taken, but the damage already inflicted is immense.
5- DESIGNS OF NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN
     Russia's clamour about the pull-out of its troops does not match its actual deeds inside Afghanistan. Efforts are being made, on different levels, to make Afghan provinces adjacent to the Soviet Union dependent on the latter. Regions on both sides of the Oxus are allowed to establish direct contacts without any reference to their respective central governments as if they were independent political entities. As a complement to this policy, persons and groups in Kabul who are originally from northern Afghanistan are encourage, no doubt by the KGB, to organise new political parties. SAZA and SAWZA are examples of this. So in addition to the construction of an infrastructure in the provinces of northern Afghanistan, as pointed out earlier, the manipulation of these people and groups is especially intended to further the Russians1 aims. In the light of these developments and many others it seems likely that Russia intends to separate northern Afghanistan from the rest of the country when other options fail.
6‘ NOSTALGIA FOR THE EX-KING
      The Afghans throughout the country are tired of the war. They long for peace but only when the Russians have quit their land. As has been well established, their opposition to the Russian occupation of their fatherland is truly strong and quite extraordinary despite the devastations of the war, and despite their poverty. In the time since the Russians
                                       5
AFGHAN INFORMATION CENTRE - Monthly Bulletin
 indicated their willingness to leave, the problem of the formation of an independent national government has occupied the minds of almost every Afghan. Inside Afghanistan the consensus is for the ex-king, around whom the majority of the Afghans are likely to rally for at least an interim period. In the present circumstances it seems that he is the only person under whom peace will have a chance to come, and bloodshed avoided.
 7- CLAMOUR FOR UNITY
      It is generally held throughout the country that had the Mujahideen been united or at least they coordinated their military efforts Russia would have already left Afghanistan. It is forcefully stressed that their failure to unite , and worse than that the bickering of the various Mujahid commanders inside Afghanistan, has actually made the Russians optimistic about their chances of eventual victory. It has weakened the resistance movement. Another related point is the excesses committed in some regions by the Mujahideen against the ldespite the fact that the latter are the unwavering supporters of the former. This shortcoming could be alleviated by fixing salaries for the Mujahideen, who have no regular income to support their families. To avoid further damage to th.e cause of the resistance movement almost every Afghan inside Afghanistan clamours for the adoption of effective measures about these important points. The public seems almost disappointed that so far the Mujahid leaders have failed to evolve a political leadership suitable for the                especial-
  ly now that negotiations on the political future have become more serious than before.
  8- HARDSHIP OF LIFE
                       A background to popular discontent are problems

like severe inflation, shortage of fuel and the frequent cutting of electric power, even in cold season in Kabul. Added to this is the partial or complete destruction of the irrigation system in many parts of the country, which has led to food shortages. If foodstuffs of various kinds do not reach Kabul from Pakistan and Russia the shortages will no doubt become acute with serious political repercussions. More than anything else it may weaken the resistance movement considerably.
   RES ISTANCE SOEXD/XR I TY
      When on Nov. 18, 1987, the Russians started their leagest even offensive in Paktia in order to prevent the besieged Khost Garrison from surrendering to the mujahideen. Commander Jalaluddin Haqani appealed to all resistance commanders of Afghanistan to launch simultaneous attacks on regime targets in their own areas in order to make enemy troops movement difficult all over the^ country, and especially to disrupt their reinforcement of Paktia.
      The appeal seems to have received positive responses from various commanders in different parts of Afghanistan. Here are some examples of resistance operations which were gestures of solidarity with the Zadran and Khost mujahideen.

 PAKTIA
                 INTERVIEW WITH MAULAWI HAQANI COMMANDER OF ZADRAN FRONT
       On Nov. 18, the Soviet-Kabul forces launched their largest offensive of the .year in Paktia. The first convoy of food and other supplies reached Khost on Dec. 30. The Kdbul-Soviet authorities claimed victory. But it took an enemy force of ten thousand Russians and eight thousand Kabul troops about U2 days to open the Gardez-Khost road, a distance of 122 kilometres.Observers acquainted with the situation knew from the start that the mujahideen did not h^ve a regular army and could not wage a conventional war. But still people were surprised to see that the mujahideen were able to slow down the advance of the huge force, an advapce which the enemy had intended to be dramatically fast. Landing at Khost airfield is still not safe, there is no normal traffic between Khost and Gardez and the mujahideen h^ve started attacking the newly built military posts along the road.

  Mira.nshah, the Pakistani town near the Afghan border .
       Q: What was the reason for the large Russian-Kabul offensive against your front in Zadran \&1-ley ?
       A. For three months the town of Khost has been besieged by the mujahideen, and the road between Gardez and Khost had been blocked by the mujahideen for nine years. Also, mujahideen supply routes to other parts of Afghanistan cross the areas of Khost and Zadran. The Kabul-Russi an authorities were forced to do something dramatic about their military failure in Paktia.
       Q: Is the siege of Khost still going on?
       A: The economic siege of Khost has ended, because the regime has brought in three convoys of foodstuffs. But the military encirclement is not broken. The mujahideen are still fighting along the road between Khost and Gardez.
       Q: Was the latest offensive the first major effort to open the land connection with Khost;?
     A:No, on several occasions in the past years the enemy tried to open the road, but we succeeded in keeping it closed. From the beginning of jehad, we were attacked eight times, twice in Zormat, twice in Zhawar, three times in Zadran and once in Urgun. Each time our guerilla groups fought against the advance of a well-equipped regular army.
       Q: Did other mujahideen from other provinces help you?
       A: At the beginning of the offensive I sent messages to the mujahideen commanders in other provinces to attack Russian troops in their own areas.

  such as Commander Qari Baba (Ghazni), Mullah Malang (Kandahar) and Masoud (Panjsher). For that reason, they showed solidarity with our front by launching heavy attacks on the enemy in the provinces of Kandahar, Ningrahar, Parwan, Badghis, Ghor and Herat.
  In addition, some 1,000 Afghans from refugee camps approached us to join the fighting.
       Q: What is the present situation along the Gardez-Khost road?
       A: At present, the road between Khost and Satu Kandau remains under mujahideen pressure. We have decided to encircle the newly established enemy posts, and make the route unsafe for traffic.
       Q: What kinds of weapons and troops were used by the Russians?
       A: During the battle, the Russians used long range heavy artillery, splinter bombs, their aircraft dropped heavy bombs and anti-personnel mines, and many Russian special commandos were involved in the battle.
       Q: There is a rumour that the Russians have reached your base at Sarana* Is this true?
       A: The Russian troops are in Mira Jan Bazaar,
  which is still far from Sarana.
       Q: What was the effect of the enemy operation upon the people?
       A: Because of Russian ground and air attacks on fcue villages, over 10,000 families from Zadran Valley came over to Pakistan as refugees. Fifty women and children have been killed and many villages in Zadran Valley have been completely destroyed.
       Q: How many Russian and Kabul troops partici-

  pated in the battle?
        A: There were about  24,000 Kabul and Russian
  soldiers, 6,000 tanks and other vehicles. Seventy aircraft of various types operated each day.
        Q: There was a rumour that you had forbidden other mujahideen to go to Zadran \&lley. Is this true ?
      AtThis is totally untrue. Other mujahideen approach us daily, but we are trying to have a coordinated plan for our battle.
        Q: What about enemy casualties?
        A: More than 1,000 Russian-Kabul soldiers were killed and seven aircraft shot down. However, the number of wounded soldiers and destroyed vehicles is not yet known. Neverthless, our sources in Kabul reported that the hospitals in the city were bursting with injured troops from Khost and Zadran.
  On our side, 140 mujahids were killed and 150 injured.
        Q: What do you think about the Soviet troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, as was announced by the Russian authorities?
        A:  The Russians have invaded our country and
  they will have to leave. But I don't believe in what they promise and say; because they never keep their promises and never do what they say. Contrary 1 to what they say the war is still going on and we i will have to continue our jehad until the last Russian leaves Afghanistan and our people obtain the right to determine their future.

LAGHM AN
                   INTERVIEW WITH GROUP COMMANDER MAJID
      A commander of Jamiat (Prof. Rabani), Abdul Majid, who came from Nuristan of Laghman Province on Jan. 14, told us about the situation in his area. He said:
      "On Dec. 27 and 28, the mujahideen carried out joint attacks on regime positions in Laghman, inflic ting heavy losses on the enemy. The mujahideen also downed two helicopters in Barikot (Kunar) and Nuristan (Laghman). In addition, we attacked regime targets in Alingar and Mango and destroyed nine posts in the area."
      According to the commander, a joint council has been established by mujahideen organisations in the area. Siddiqi, general commander of Harakat (Mau lawi Mohammadi), is president of the council. The council, which decides important issues, also comprises judicial, financial, military and civil committees. These committees are composed of members of various resistance organisations. There are 4,000 armed mujahideen in the area.
      The biggest victory for the mujahideen, he said was the recent surrender of the supporters of Sarwar Nuristani along with their weapons. Maulawi Agzin, the religious figure who supported Sarwar, turned against him, and is now working for the mujahideen. (Sarwar Nuristani, a former Afghan army officer and chief of army staff during President Daoud's rule (1973-197$)* was appointed by the Taraki-Amin regime (1978-1979) as military attache in New Delhi; after the Soviet invasion and the establishment of the Kar mal regime he defected to Pakistan. At the end of

1982, he defected back to the communist regime, went to Nuristan and started organising and arming militia units for Kabul.)
      The commander added:
      "The residents of our area are faced with a lack of medicine and of medical personnel. Food shortages do not exist in the area, because people still live in western 'Nuristan. Barely ten percent of families have left the area."

      "Our groups carry out two kinds of operations against the enemy. First open operations conducted against regime and Russian posts in the areas of Paghman f Char Asiab and Shakardara, and secondly underground operations inside the city through our connections.                               A

 important Khalqi and Parchaml criminals. Recently. we fired rockets on the Russian base at Darul Aman from Lalandar (south of Kabul),and parts of the base were set on fire. Also on Dec. 27 in another operation against Russian positions in Darul Aman, 11 Russians were killed and two tanks and three military trucks destroyed."
      According to the commander 9 guerilla activities inside the city are difficult. However, mujahideen anti-aircraft weapons have created serious . fears among the officers of the ministry of defence. According to some sources, regime officers and pilots avoid flying over some areas. R>r example, many officers tried to find excuses not carry out bombing missions over Zadran telley during the recent offensive. Low-ranking officers, especially those who are sent to the fronts dispute and even disobey decision-making party authorities. Corruption has increased in the ministries of defence, home affairs, KHAD and committees of civil defence.
 Regime officers offer and take bribes, and competition between Khalqi and Parchami members to make money is more important than their ideological differences .
     Asked about the opinion of regime high-ranking officers and other authorities about the current political situation in Afghanistan, the commander
 said:
      "Serious discussions about the political settlement have been continuing among regime officers for two months.
